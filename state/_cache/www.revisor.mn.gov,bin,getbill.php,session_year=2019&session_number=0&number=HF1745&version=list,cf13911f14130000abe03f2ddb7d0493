        <p>The legislature finds that the disposal and transportation of high-level radioactive waste is of vital concern to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of Minnesota, and to the economic and environmental resources of Minnesota. To ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the people, and to protect the air, land, water, and other natural resources in the state from pollution, impairment, or destruction, it is necessary for the state to regulate and control, under the laws of the United States, the exploration for high-level radioactive waste disposal within the state of Minnesota. It is the intent of the legislature to exercise all legal authority for the purpose of regulating the disposal and transportation of high-level radioactive waste.</p>

          <p class="in">(i) located within 400 miles of the site of the biomass production; and</p>
          <p class="in">(ii) designed to use biomass to meet at least 75 percent of its fuel requirements.</p>
          <p class="in">(b) The legislature finds that the negative environmental impacts within 400 miles of the facility resulting from transporting and combusting the biomass are offset in that region by the environmental benefits to air, soil, and water of the biomass production.</p>
          <p class="in">(c) Among the biomass fuel sources that meet the requirements of paragraph (a), clauses (1) and (2), are poplar, aspen, willow, switch grass, sorghum, alfalfa, cultivated prairie grass, and sustainably managed woody biomass.</p>
          <p class="in">(d) For the purpose of this section, "sustainably managed woody biomass" means:</p>
          <p class="in">(1) brush, trees, and other biomass harvested from within designated utility, railroad, and road rights-of-way;</p>
          <p class="in">(2) upland and lowland brush harvested from lands incorporated into brushland habitat management activities of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources;</p>
          <p class="in">(3) upland and lowland brush harvested from lands managed in accordance with Minnesota Department of Natural Resources "Best Management Practices for Managing Brushlands";</p>
          <p class="in">(4) logging slash or waste wood that is created by harvest, by precommercial timber stand improvement to meet silvicultural objectives, or by fire, disease, or insect control treatments, and that is managed in compliance with the Minnesota Forest Resources Council's "Sustaining Minnesota Forest Resources: Voluntary Site-Level Forest Management Guidelines for Landowners, Loggers and Resource Managers" as modified by the requirement of this subdivision; and</p>
          <p class="in">(5) trees or parts of trees that do not meet the utilization standards for pulpwood, posts, bolts, or sawtimber as described in the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Division of Forestry Timber Sales Manual, 1998, as amended as of May 1, 2005, and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Timber Scaling Manual, 1981, as amended as of May 1, 2005, except as provided in paragraph (a), clause (1), and this paragraph, clauses (1) to (3).</p>

          <p>(a) This subdivision applies only to a biomass project owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by two municipal utilities as described in subdivision 5a, paragraph (b).</p>
          <p>(b) Woody biomass from state-owned land must be harvested in compliance with an adopted management plan and a program of ecologically based third-party certification.</p>
          <p>(c) The project must prepare a fuel plan on an annual basis after commercial operation of the project as described in the power contract between the project and the public utility, and must also prepare annually certificates reflecting the types of fuel used in the preceding year by the project, as described in the power contract. The fuel plans and certificates shall also be filed with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the Minnesota Department of Commerce within 30 days after being provided to the public utility, as provided by the power contract. Any person who believes the fuel plans, as amended, and certificates show that the project does not or will not comply with the fuel requirements of this subdivision may file a petition with the commission seeking such a determination.</p>
          <p>(d) The wood procurement process must utilize third-party audit certification systems to verify that applicable best management practices were utilized in the procurement of the sustainably managed biomass. If there is a failure to so verify in any two consecutive years during the original contract term, the farm-grown closed-loop biomass requirements of subdivision 2 must be increased to 50 percent for the remaining contract term period; however, if in two consecutive subsequent years after the increase has been implemented, it is verified that the conditions in this subdivision have been met, then for the remaining original contract term the closed-loop biomass mandate reverts to 25 percent. If there is a subsequent failure to verify in a year after the first failure and implementation of the 50 percent requirement, then the closed-loop percentage shall remain at 50 percent for each remaining year of the contract term.</p>
          <p>(e) In the closed-loop plantation, no transgenic plants may be used.</p>
          <p>(f) No wood may be harvested from any lands identified by the final or preliminary Minnesota County Biological Survey as having statewide significance as native plant communities, large populations or concentrations of rare species, or critical animal habitat.</p>

          <p>(a) Notwithstanding subdivision 5, the biomass electric energy mandate must be reduced from 125 megawatts to 110 megawatts.</p>
          <p>(b) The Public Utilities Commission shall approve a request pending before the commission as of May 15, 2003, for amendments to and assignment of a power purchase agreement with the owner of a facility that uses short-rotation, woody crops as its primary fuel previously approved to satisfy a portion of the biomass mandate if the owner of the project agrees to reduce the size of its project from 50 megawatts to 35 megawatts, while maintaining an average price for energy in nominal dollars measured over the term of the power purchase agreement at or below $104 per megawatt-hour, exclusive of any price adjustments that may take effect subsequent to commission approval of the power purchase agreement, as amended. The commission shall also approve, as necessary, any subsequent assignment or sale of the power purchase agreement or ownership of the project to an entity owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by two municipal utilities located north of Constitutional Route No. 8, as described in section <a href="/statutes/cite/161.114">161.114</a>, which currently own electric and steam generation facilities using coal as a fuel and which propose to retrofit their existing municipal electrical generating facilities to utilize biomass fuels in order to perform the power purchase agreement.</p>
          <p>(c) If the power purchase agreement described in paragraph (b) is assigned to an entity that is, or becomes, owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by two municipal entities as described in paragraph (b), and the power purchase agreement meets the price requirements of paragraph (b), the commission shall approve any amendments to the power purchase agreement necessary to reflect the changes in project location and ownership and any other amendments made necessary by those changes. The commission shall also specifically find that:</p>
          <p>(1) the power purchase agreement complies with and fully satisfies the provisions of this section to the full extent of its 35-megawatt capacity;</p>
          <p>(2) all costs incurred by the public utility and all amounts to be paid by the public utility to the project owner under the terms of the power purchase agreement are fully recoverable pursuant to section <a href="/statutes/cite/216B.1645">216B.1645</a>;</p>
          <p>(3) subject to prudency review by the commission, the public utility may recover from its Minnesota retail customers the amounts that may be incurred and paid by the public utility during the full term of the power purchase agreement; and</p>
          <p>(4) if the purchase power agreement meets the requirements of this subdivision, it is reasonable and in the public interest.</p>
          <p>(d) The commission shall specifically approve recovery by the public utility of any and all Minnesota jurisdictional costs incurred by the public utility to improve, construct, install, or upgrade transmission, distribution, or other electrical facilities owned by the public utility or other persons in order to permit interconnection of the retrofitted biomass-fueled generating facilities or to obtain transmission service for the energy provided by the facilities to the public utility pursuant to section <a href="/statutes/cite/216B.1645">216B.1645</a>, and shall disapprove any provision in the power purchase agreement that requires the developer or owner of the project to pay the jurisdictional costs or that permit the public utility to terminate the power purchase agreement as a result of the existence of those costs or the public utility's obligation to pay any or all of those costs.</p>
          <p>(e) Upon request by the project owner, the public utility shall agree to amend the power purchase agreement described in paragraph (b) and approved by the commission as required by paragraph (c). The amendment must be negotiated and executed within 45 days of May 14, 2013, and must apply to prices paid after January 1, 2014. The average price for energy in nominal dollars measured over the term of the power purchase agreement must not exceed $109.20 per megawatt hour. The public utility shall request approval of the amendment by the commission within 30 days of execution of the amended power purchase agreement. The amendment is not effective until approval by the commission. The commission shall act on the amendment within 90 days of submission of the request by the public utility. Upon approval of the amended power purchase agreement, the commission shall allow the public utility to recover the costs of the amended power purchase agreement, as provided in section <a href="/statutes/cite/216B.1645">216B.1645</a>.</p>
          <p>(f) With respect to the power purchase agreement described in paragraph (b), and amended and approved by the commission pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (e), upon request by the project owner, the public utility shall agree to amend the power purchase agreement to include a fuel cost adjustment clause which requires the public utility to reimburse the project owner monthly for all costs incurred by the project owner during the applicable month to procure and transport all fuel used to produce energy for delivery to the public utility pursuant to the power purchase agreement to the extent such costs exceeded $3.40 per million metric British thermal unit (MMBTU), in addition to the price to be paid for the energy produced and delivered by the project owner. Reimbursable costs include but are not limited to: (1) all costs incurred to load fuel at its source; (2) costs to transport fuel (i) to the biomass-fueled generating facilities or to an intermediate woodyard, storage facility, or handling facility, or (ii) from a facility to the biomass-fueled generating facilities; (3) depreciation of any depreciable loading, woodyard, storage, handling, or transportation equipment whether the vehicle or equipment is located at the fuel source, a woodyard, storage facility, handling facility, or at the generating facilities; and (4) costs to unload fuel at the generating facilities. Beginning with 2014, at the end of each calendar year of the term of the power purchase agreement, the project owner shall calculate the amount by which actual fuel costs for the year exceeded $3.40 per MMBTU, and prior monthly payment for such fuel costs shall be reconciled against actual fuel costs for the applicable calendar year. If such prior monthly fuel payments for the year in the aggregate exceed the amount due based on the annual calculation, the project owner shall credit the public utility for the excess paid. If the annual calculation of fuel costs due exceeds the prior monthly fuel payments for the year in the aggregate, the project owner shall be entitled to be paid for the deficiency with the next invoice to the public utility. The amendment shall be negotiated and executed within 45 days of May 13, 2013, and shall be effective for fuel costs incurred and prices after January 1, 2014. The public utility shall request approval of the amendment by the commission, and the commission shall approve the amendment as reasonable and in the public interest and allow the public utility to recover from its Minnesota retail customers the amounts paid by the public utility to the project owner pursuant to the power purchase agreement during the full term of the power purchase agreement, including the reimbursement of fuel costs pursuant to the power purchase agreement amendment, reimbursable costs as provided in this paragraph, pursuant to section <a href="/statutes/cite/216B.1645">216B.1645</a>, or otherwise.</p>
          <p>(g) With respect to the power purchase agreement described in paragraph (b) and approved by the commission pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (e), the public utility is prohibited from recovering from the project owner any costs which were not actually and reasonably incurred by the utility, notwithstanding any provision in the power purchase agreement to the contrary. In addition, beginning with 2012, the public utility shall pay for all energy delivered by the project owner pursuant to the power purchase agreement at the full price for such energy in the power purchase agreement approved and amended pursuant to paragraph (e), provided that the project owner does not deliver more than 110 percent of the amount scheduled for delivery in any year of the power purchase agreement, and does not deliver, on average over any five consecutive years of the power purchase agreement, an amount greater than 105 percent of the amount scheduled for delivery over the five-year period.</p>

          <p>(a) If there remain megawatts of biomass power generating capacity to fulfill the mandate in subdivision 5 after the commission has taken final action on all contracts filed by September 1, 2000, by a public utility, as amended and assigned, this subdivision governs final compliance with the biomass energy mandate in subdivision 5 subject to the requirements of subdivisions 7 and 8.</p>
          <p>(b) To the extent not inconsistent with this subdivision, the provisions of subdivisions 2, 3, 4, and 5 apply to proposals subject to this subdivision.</p>
          <p>(c) A public utility must submit proposals to the commission to complete the biomass mandate. The commission shall require a public utility subject to this section to issue a request for competitive proposals for projects for electric generation utilizing biomass as defined in paragraph (f) of this subdivision to provide the remaining megawatts of the mandate. The commission shall set an expedited schedule for submission of proposals to the utility, selection by the utility of proposals or projects, negotiation of contracts, and review by the commission of the contracts or projects submitted by the utility to the commission.</p>
          <p>(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions 1 to 5 but subject to the provisions of subdivisions 7 and 8, a new or existing facility proposed under this subdivision that is fueled either by biomass or by co-firing biomass with nonbiomass may satisfy the mandate in this section. Such a facility need not use biomass that complies with the definition in subdivision 1 if it uses biomass as defined in paragraph (f) of this subdivision. Generating capacity produced by co-firing of biomass that is operational as of April 25, 2000, does not meet the requirements of the mandate, except that additional co-firing capacity added at an existing facility after April 25, 2000, may be used to satisfy this mandate. Only the number of megawatts of capacity at a facility which co-fires biomass that are directly attributable to the biomass and that become operational after April 25, 2000, count toward meeting the biomass mandate in this section.</p>
          <p>(e) Nothing in this subdivision precludes a facility proposed and approved under this subdivision from using fuel sources that are not biomass in compliance with subdivision 3.</p>
          <p>(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 1, for proposals subject to this subdivision, "biomass" includes farm-grown closed-loop biomass; agricultural wastes, including animal, poultry, and plant wastes; and waste wood, including chipped wood, bark, brush, residue wood, and sawdust.</p>

          <p>(1) a new or amended power purchase agreement;</p>
          <p>(2) the early termination of a power purchase agreement; or</p>
          <p>(3) the purchase and closure of the facility.</p>
          <p>(b) The commission may approve a new or amended power purchase agreement under this subdivision, notwithstanding the fuel requirements of this section, if the commission determines that:</p>
          <p>(1) all parties to the original power purchase agreement, or their successors or assigns, as applicable, agree to the terms and conditions of the new or amended power purchase agreement; and</p>
          <p>(2) the new or amended power purchase agreement is in the best interest of the customers of the public utility subject to this section, taking into consideration any savings realized by customers in the new or amended power purchase agreement and any costs imposed on customers under paragraph (e). A new or amended power purchase agreement approved under this paragraph may be for any term agreed to by the parties and may govern the purchase of any amount of energy.</p>
          <p>(c) The commission may approve the early termination of a power purchase agreement or the purchase and closure of a facility under this subdivision if it determines that:</p>
          <p>(1) all parties to the power purchase agreement, or their successors or assigns, as applicable, agree to the early termination of the power purchase agreement or the purchase and closure of the facility; and</p>
          <p>(2) the early termination of the power purchase agreement or the purchase and closure of the facility is in the best interest of the customers of the public utility subject to this section, taking into consideration any savings realized by customers as a result of the early termination of the power purchase agreement or the purchase and closure of the facility and any costs imposed on the customers under paragraph (e).</p>
          <p>(d) The commission's approval of a new or amended power purchase agreement under paragraph (b) or of the termination of a power purchase agreement or the purchase and closure of a facility under paragraph (c), shall not require the public utility subject to this section to purchase replacement amounts of biomass energy to fulfill the requirements of this section.</p>
          <p>(e) A utility may petition the commission to approve a rate schedule that provides for the automatic adjustment of charges to recover investments, expenses and costs, and earnings on the investments associated with a new or amended power purchase agreement, the early termination of a power purchase agreement, or the purchase and closure of a facility. The commission may approve the rate schedule upon a showing that the recovery of investments, expenses and costs, and earnings on the investments is less than the costs that would have been recovered from customers had the utility continued to purchase energy under the power purchase agreement in effect before any option available under this section is approved by the commission. If approved by the commission, cost recovery under this paragraph may include all cost recovery allowed for renewable facilities under section <a href="/statutes/cite/216B.1645">216B.1645</a>, subdivisions 2 and 2a.</p>
          <p>(f) This subdivision does not apply to a St. Paul district heating and cooling system cogeneration facility, and nothing in this subdivision precludes a public utility that operates a nuclear-power electric generating plant from filing a petition with the commission for approval of a new or amended power purchase agreement with such a facility.</p>
          <p>(g) For the purposes of this subdivision, "facility" means a biomass facility previously approved by the commission to satisfy a portion of the biomass mandate in this section.</p>

          <p class="in">The plan required by subdivision 2 must be developed through a structured, broadly inclusive stakeholder-based review of potential policies and initiatives that will reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions from a broad range of sources and activities. The commissioner shall engage a nationally recognized independent expert entity to conduct the stakeholder process. The report of the stakeholder process must form the basis for the plan submitted by the commissioner under subdivision 2.</p>

          <p class="in">The plan must:</p>
          <p class="in">(1) estimate 1990 and 2005 greenhouse gas emissions in the state and make projections of emissions in 2015, 2025, and 2050;</p>
          <p class="in">(2) identify, evaluate, and integrate a broad range of statewide greenhouse gas reduction options for all emission sectors in the state;</p>
          <p class="in">(3) assess the costs, benefits, and feasibility of implementing the options;</p>
          <p class="in">(4) recommend an integrated set of reduction options and strategies for implementing the options that will achieve the goals in subdivision 1, including analysis of the associated costs and benefits to Minnesotans;</p>
          <p class="in">(5) estimate the statewide greenhouse gas emissions reductions anticipated from implementation of existing state policies;</p>
          <p class="in">(6) recommend a system to require the reporting of statewide greenhouse gas emissions, identifying which facilities must report, and how emission estimates should be made; and</p>
          <p class="in">(7) evaluate the option of exempting a project from the prohibitions contained in section <a href="/statutes/cite/216H.03#stat.216H.03.3">216H.03, subdivision 3</a>, if the project contributes a specified fee per ton of carbon dioxide emissions emitted annually by the project, the proceeds of which would be used to fund permanent, quantifiable, verifiable, and enforceable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that would not otherwise have occurred.</p>

          <h3 class="headnote">Specific plan requirements.</h3>
          <p class="in">(a) The plan must evaluate and recommend interim goals as steps to achieve the goals in subdivision 1.</p>
          <p class="in">(b) The plan must determine the feasibility, assess the costs and benefits, and recommend how the state could adopt a regulatory system that imposes a cap on the aggregate air pollutant emissions of a group of sources, requires those subject to the cap to own an allowance for each ton of the air pollutant emitted, and allows for market-based trading of those allowances. The evaluation must contain an analysis of the state implementing a cap and trade system alone, in coordination with other states, and as a requirement of federal law applying to all states. The plan must recommend the parameters of a cap and trade system that includes a cap that would prevent significant increases in greenhouse gas emissions above current levels with a schedule for lowering the cap periodically to achieve the goals in subdivision 1 and interim goals recommended under paragraph (a). The plan must consider cost savings and cost increases on energy consumers in the state.</p>
          <p class="in">(c) The plan must include recommendations for improvements in the emissions inventory and recommend whether the state should require greenhouse gas emissions reporting from specific sources and, if so, which sources should be required to report. The plan must also evaluate options for an emissions registry after reviewing registries in other states and recommend a registry that will insure the greatest opportunity for Minnesota entities to obtain marketable credits.</p>

          <p class="in">The state must, to the extent possible, with other states in the Midwest region, develop and implement a regional approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from activities in the region, including consulting on a regional cap and trade system. The commissioner of commerce shall coordinate Minnesota's regional activities under this subdivision and report to the legislative committees in the senate and house of representatives with jurisdiction over energy and environmental policy by February 1, 2008, and February 1, 2009, on the progress made and recommendations for further action. The commissioner of commerce, as part of the activities required under this subdivision, must meet with responsible officials from bordering states, other states in the Midwest region, and states in other regions of the country to:</p>
          <p>(1) determine whether other states are interested in establishing and cooperating in a multistate or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade allowance program;</p>
          <p>(2) identify and prepare an inventory of greenhouse gas reduction resources available to support a multistate or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade allowance program;</p>
          <p>(3) seek cooperation on a regional inventory of greenhouse gas emission sources; and</p>
          <p>(4) prepare an inventory of available renewable energy resources within a state or region.</p>
          <p class="in">The commissioner of commerce must develop a definition of scope of this regional activity that is in addition to the components described in clauses (1) to (4). The commissioner must report on the additional scoping definitions to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with jurisdiction over energy and environmental finance and policy on or before the commencement of the 2008 regular legislative session.</p>
