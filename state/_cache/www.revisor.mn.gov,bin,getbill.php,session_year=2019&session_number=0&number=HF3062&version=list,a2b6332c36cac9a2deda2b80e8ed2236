          <p>(g) If the commissioner responsible for regulating the third-party purchaser finds at any time that the third-party purchaser has not complied with this section, the commissioner may take enforcement action against a third-party purchaser which is subject to the commissioner's regulatory jurisdiction and which does not allow a hospital, surgical center, pharmacy, or provider to pass-through the tax expense. The commissioner may by order fine or censure the third-party purchaser or revoke or suspend the certificate of authority or license of the third-party purchaser to do business in this state if the commissioner finds that the third-party purchaser has not complied with this section.
