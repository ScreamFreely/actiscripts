          <h3 class="headnote">Support grants; criteria and limitations.</h3>
          <p class="in">(a) A county board may choose to participate in the consumer support grant program. If a county has not chosen to participate by July 1, 2002, the commissioner shall contract with another county or other entity to provide access to residents of the nonparticipating county who choose the consumer support grant option. The commissioner shall notify the county board in a county that has declined to participate of the commissioner's intent to enter into a contract with another county or other entity at least 30 days in advance of entering into the contract. The local agency shall establish written procedures and criteria to determine the amount and use of support grants. These procedures must include, at least, the availability of respite care, assistance with daily living, and adaptive aids. The local agency may establish monthly or annual maximum amounts for grants and procedures where exceptional resources may be required to meet the health and safety needs of the person on a time-limited basis, however, the total amount awarded to each individual may not exceed the limits established in subdivision 11.</p>
          <p class="in">(b) Support grants to a person, a person's legal representative, or other authorized representative will be provided through a monthly subsidy payment and be in the form of cash, voucher, or direct county payment to vendor.

          <p class="in">(4) it must be consistent with the needs identified in the service agreement, when applicable.</p>
          <p class="in">(c) Items and services purchased with support grants must be those for which there are no other public or private funds available to the person, a person's legal representative, or other authorized representative. Fees assessed to the person or the person's family for health and human services are not reimbursable through the grant.</p>
          <p class="in">(d) In approving or denying applications, the local agency shall consider the following factors:</p>
          <p class="in">(1) the extent and areas of the person's functional limitations;</p>
          <p class="in">(2) the degree of need in the home environment for additional support; and</p>
          <p class="in">(3) the potential effectiveness of the grant to maintain and support the person in the family environment or the person's own home.</p>
          <p class="in">(e) At the time of application to the program or screening for other services, the person, a person's legal representative, or other authorized representative shall be provided sufficient information to ensure an informed choice of alternatives by the person, the person's legal representative, or other authorized representative, if any. The application shall be made to the local agency and shall specify the needs of the person or the person's legal representative or other authorized representative, the form and amount of grant requested, the items and services to be reimbursed, and evidence of eligibility for medical assistance.</p>
          <p class="in">(f) Upon approval of an application by the local agency and agreement on a support plan for the person or the person's legal representative or other authorized representative, the local agency shall make grants to the person or the person's legal representative or other authorized representative. The grant shall be in an amount for the direct costs of the services or supports outlined in the service agreement.</p>
          <p class="in">(g) Reimbursable costs shall not include costs for resources already available, such as special education classes, day training and habilitation, case management, other services to which the person is entitled, medical costs covered by insurance or other health programs, or other resources usually available at no cost to the person or the person's legal representative or other authorized representative.</p>
          <p class="in">(h) The state of Minnesota, the county boards participating in the consumer support grant program, or the agencies acting on behalf of the county boards in the implementation and administration of the consumer support grant program shall not be liable for damages, injuries, or liabilities sustained through the purchase of support by the individual, the individual's family, or the authorized representative under this section with funds received through the consumer support grant program. Liabilities include but are not limited to: workers' compensation liability, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), or the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA). For purposes of this section, participating county boards and agencies acting on behalf of county boards are exempt from the provisions of section <a href="/statutes/cite/268.035">268.035</a>.</p>

          <p class="in">(b) At the beginning of each fiscal year, county allocations for consumer support grants shall be based on:</p>
          <p class="in">(1) the number of persons to whom the county board expects to provide consumer supports grants;</p>
          <p class="in">(2) their eligibility for current program and services;</p>
          <p class="in">(3) the monthly grant levels allowed under subdivision 11; and</p>
          <p class="in">(4) projected dates when persons will start receiving grants. County allocations shall be adjusted periodically by the commissioner based on the actual transfer of persons or service openings, and the monthly grant levels associated with those persons or service openings, to the consumer support grant program.</p>
          <p class="in">(c) The amount of funds transferred by the commissioner from the medical assistance account for an individual may be changed if it is determined by the county or its agent that the individual's need for support has changed.</p>
          <p class="in">(d) The authority to utilize funds transferred to the consumer support grant account for the purposes of implementing and administering the consumer support grant program will not be limited or constrained by the spending authority provided to the program of origination.</p>
          <p class="in">(e) The commissioner may use up to five percent of each county's allocation, as adjusted, for payments for administrative expenses, to be paid as a proportionate addition to reported direct service expenditures.</p>
          <p class="in">(f) The county allocation for each person or the person's legal representative or other authorized representative cannot exceed the amount allowed under subdivision 11.</p>
          <p class="in">(g) The commissioner may recover, suspend, or withhold payments if the county board, local agency, or grantee does not comply with the requirements of this section.</p>
          <p class="in">(h) Grant funds unexpended by consumers shall return to the state once a year. The annual return of unexpended grant funds shall occur in the quarter following the end of the state fiscal year.</p>

          <p>Medical assistance covers personal care assistance services in a recipient's home. Effective January 1, 2010, to qualify for personal care assistance services, a recipient must require assistance and be determined dependent in one activity of daily living as defined in section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.0659#stat.256B.0659.1">256B.0659, subdivision 1</a>, paragraph (b), or in a Level I behavior as defined in section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.0659#stat.256B.0659.1">256B.0659, subdivision 1</a>, paragraph (c). Recipients or responsible parties must be able to identify the recipient's needs, direct and evaluate task accomplishment, and provide for health and safety. Approved hours may be used outside the home when normal life activities take them outside the home. To use personal care assistance services at school, the recipient or responsible party must provide written authorization in the care plan identifying the chosen provider and the daily amount of services to be used at school. Total hours for services, whether actually performed inside or outside the recipient's home, cannot exceed that which is otherwise allowed for personal care assistance services in an in-home setting according to sections <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.0651">256B.0651</a> to <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.0654">256B.0654</a>. Medical assistance does not cover personal care assistance services for residents of a hospital, nursing facility, intermediate care facility, health care facility licensed by the commissioner of health, or unless a resident who is otherwise eligible is on leave from the facility and the facility either pays for the personal care assistance services or forgoes the facility per diem for the leave days that personal care assistance services are used.

Assessments for personal care assistance services shall be conducted by the county public health nurse or a certified public health nurse under contract with the county except when a long-term care consultation assessment is being conducted for the purposes of determining a person's eligibility for home and community-based waiver services including personal care assistance services according to section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.0911">256B.0911</a>.

Once the need for personal care assistance services is determined under this section, the county public health nurse or certified public health nurse under contract with the county is responsible for communicating this recommendation to the commissioner and the recipient. An in-person assessment must occur at least annually or when there is a significant change in the recipient's condition or when there is a change in the need for personal care assistance services. A service update may substitute for the annual face-to-face assessment when there is not a significant change in recipient condition or a change in the need for personal care assistance service. A service update may be completed by telephone, used when there is no need for an increase in personal care assistance services, and used for two consecutive assessments if followed by a face-to-face assessment. A service update must be completed on a form approved by the commissioner. A service update or review for temporary increase includes a review of initial baseline data, evaluation of service effectiveness, redetermination of service need, modification of service plan and appropriate referrals, update of initial forms, obtaining service authorization, and on going consumer education. Assessments or reassessments must be completed on forms provided by the commissioner within 30 days of a request for home care services by a recipient or responsible party.</p>

          <h3 class="headnote">Flexible use.</h3>
          <p>(a) "Flexible use" means the scheduled use of authorized hours of personal care assistance services, which vary within a service authorization period covering no more than six months, in order to more effectively meet the needs and schedule of the recipient. Each 12-month service agreement is divided into two six-month authorization date spans. No more than 75 percent of the total authorized units for a 12-month service agreement may be used in a six-month date span.</p>
          <p>(b) Authorization of flexible use occurs during the authorization process under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.0652">256B.0652</a>. The flexible use of authorized hours does not increase the total amount of authorized hours available to a recipient. The commissioner shall not authorize additional personal care assistance services to supplement a service authorization that is exhausted before the end date under a flexible service use plan, unless the assessor determines a change in condition and a need for increased services is established. Authorized hours not used within the six-month period must not be carried over to another time period.</p>
          <p>(c) A recipient who has terminated personal care assistance services before the end of the 12-month authorization period must not receive additional hours upon reapplying during the same 12-month authorization period, except if a change in condition is documented. Services must be prorated for the remainder of the 12-month authorization period based on the first six-month assessment.</p>
          <p>(d) The recipient, responsible party, and qualified professional must develop a written month-to-month plan of the projected use of personal care assistance services that is part of the personal care assistance care plan and ensures:</p>
          <p>(1) that the health and safety needs of the recipient are met throughout both date spans of the authorization period; and</p>
          <p>(2) that the total authorized amount of personal care assistance services for each date span must not be used before the end of each date span in the authorization period.</p>
          <p>(e) The personal care assistance provider agency shall monitor the use of personal care assistance services to ensure health and safety needs of the recipient are met throughout both date spans of the authorization period. The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall provide written notice to the provider and the recipient or responsible party when a recipient is at risk of exceeding the personal care assistance services prior to the end of the six-month period.</p>
          <p>(f) Misuse and abuse of the flexible use of personal care assistance services resulting in the overuse of units in a manner where the recipient will not have enough units to meet their needs for assistance and ensure health and safety for the entire six-month date span may lead to an action by the commissioner. The commissioner may take action including, but not limited to: (1) restricting recipients to service authorizations of no more than one month in duration; (2) requiring the recipient to have a responsible party; and (3) requiring a qualified professional to monitor and report services on a monthly basis.</p>

          <h3 class="headnote">Shared services.</h3>
          <p>(a) Medical assistance payments for shared personal care assistance services are limited according to this subdivision.</p>
          <p>(b) Shared service is the provision of personal care assistance services by a personal care assistant to two or three recipients, eligible for medical assistance, who voluntarily enter into an agreement to receive services at the same time and in the same setting.</p>
          <p>(c) For the purposes of this subdivision, "setting" means:</p>
          <p>(1) the home residence or family foster care home of one or more of the individual recipients; or</p>
          <p>(2) a child care program licensed under chapter 245A or operated by a local school district or private school.</p>
          <p>(d) Shared personal care assistance services follow the same criteria for covered services as subdivision 2.</p>
          <p>(e) Noncovered shared personal care assistance services include the following:</p>
          <p>(1) services for more than three recipients by one personal care assistant at one time;</p>
          <p>(2) staff requirements for child care programs under chapter 245C;</p>
          <p>(3) caring for multiple recipients in more than one setting;</p>
          <p>(4) additional units of personal care assistance based on the selection of the option; and</p>
          <p>(5) use of more than one personal care assistance provider agency for the shared care services.</p>
          <p>(f) The option of shared personal care assistance is elected by the recipient or the responsible party with the assistance of the assessor. The option must be determined appropriate based on the ages of the recipients, compatibility, and coordination of their assessed care needs. The recipient or the responsible party, in conjunction with the qualified professional, shall arrange the setting and grouping of shared services based on the individual needs and preferences of the recipients. The personal care assistance provider agency shall offer the recipient or the responsible party the option of shared or one-on-one personal care assistance services or a combination of both. The recipient or the responsible party may withdraw from participating in a shared services arrangement at any time.</p>
          <p>(g) Authorization for the shared service option must be determined by the commissioner based on the criteria that the shared service is appropriate to meet all of the recipients' needs and their health and safety is maintained. The authorization of shared services is part of the overall authorization of personal care assistance services. Nothing in this subdivision must be construed to reduce the total number of hours authorized for an individual recipient.</p>
          <p>(h) A personal care assistant providing shared personal care assistance services must:</p>
          <p>(1) receive training specific for each recipient served; and</p>
          <p>(2) follow all required documentation requirements for time and services provided.</p>
          <p>(i) A qualified professional shall:</p>
          <p>(1) evaluate the ability of the personal care assistant to provide services for all of the recipients in a shared setting;</p>
          <p>(2) visit the shared setting as services are being provided at least once every six months or whenever needed for response to a recipient's request for increased supervision of the personal care assistance staff;</p>
          <p>(3) provide ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness and appropriateness of the shared services;</p>
          <p>(4) develop a contingency plan with each of the recipients which accounts for absence of the recipient in a shared services setting due to illness or other circumstances;</p>
          <p>(5) obtain permission from each of the recipients who are sharing a personal care assistant for number of shared hours for services provided inside and outside the home residence; and</p>
          <p>(6) document the training completed by the personal care assistants specific to the shared setting and recipients sharing services.</p>

          <p>The commissioner shall provide a rate system for shared personal care assistance services. For two persons sharing services, the rate paid to a provider must not exceed one and one-half times the rate paid for serving a single individual, and for three persons sharing services, the rate paid to a provider must not exceed twice the rate paid for serving a single individual.

          <p>(a) The commissioner may allow a recipient of personal care assistance services to use a fiscal intermediary to assist the recipient in paying and accounting for medically necessary covered personal care assistance services. Unless otherwise provided in this section, all other statutory and regulatory provisions relating to personal care assistance services apply to a recipient using the personal care assistance choice option.</p>
          <p>(b) Personal care assistance choice is an option of the personal care assistance program that allows the recipient who receives personal care assistance services to be responsible for the hiring, training, scheduling, and firing of personal care assistants according to the terms of the written agreement with the personal care assistance choice agency required under subdivision 20, paragraph (a). This program offers greater control and choice for the recipient in who provides the personal care assistance service and when the service is scheduled. The recipient or the recipient's responsible party must choose a personal care assistance choice provider agency as a fiscal intermediary. This personal care assistance choice provider agency manages payroll, invoices the state, is responsible for all payroll-related taxes and insurance, and is responsible for providing the consumer training and support in managing the recipient's personal care assistance services.</p>

          <p>(b) Effective January 1, 2010, except for the administrative fee of the personal care assistance choice provider agency as reported on the written agreement, the remainder of the rates paid to the personal care assistance choice provider agency must be used to pay for the salary and benefits for the personal care assistant or the qualified professional.
