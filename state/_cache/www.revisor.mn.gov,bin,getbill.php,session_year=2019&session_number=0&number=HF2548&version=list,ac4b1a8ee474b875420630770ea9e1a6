          <h3 class="headnote">Consolidation of nursing facilities.</h3>
          <p>(a) The commissioner of health, in consultation with the commissioner of human services, may approve a request for consolidation of nursing facilities which includes the closure of one or more facilities and the upgrading of the physical plant of the remaining nursing facility or facilities, the costs of which exceed the threshold project limit under subdivision 2, clause (a). The commissioners shall consider the criteria in this section, section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.073">144A.073</a>, and section <a href="/statutes/cite/256R.40">256R.40</a>, in approving or rejecting a consolidation proposal. In the event the commissioners approve the request, the commissioner of human services shall calculate an external fixed costs rate adjustment according to clauses (1) to (3):</p>
          <p>(1) the closure of beds shall not be eligible for a planned closure rate adjustment under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256R.40#stat.256R.40.5">256R.40, subdivision 5</a>;</p>
          <p>(2) the construction project permitted in this clause shall not be eligible for a threshold project rate adjustment under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.434#stat.256B.434.4f">256B.434, subdivision 4f</a>, or a moratorium exception adjustment under section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.073">144A.073</a>; and</p>
          <p>(3) the payment rate for external fixed costs for a remaining facility or facilities shall be increased by an amount equal to 65 percent of the projected net cost savings to the state calculated in paragraph (b), divided by the state's medical assistance percentage of medical assistance dollars, and then divided by estimated medical assistance resident days, as determined in paragraph (c), of the remaining nursing facility or facilities in the request in this paragraph. The rate adjustment is effective on the first day of the month of January or July, whichever date occurs first following both the completion of the construction upgrades in the consolidation plan and the complete closure of the facility or facilities designated for closure in the consolidation plan. If more than one facility is receiving upgrades in the consolidation plan, each facility's date of construction completion must be evaluated separately.</p>
          <p>(b) For purposes of calculating the net cost savings to the state, the commissioner shall consider clauses (1) to (7):</p>
          <p>(1) the annual savings from estimated medical assistance payments from the net number of beds closed taking into consideration only beds that are in active service on the date of the request and that have been in active service for at least three years;</p>
          <p>(2) the estimated annual cost of increased case load of individuals receiving services under the elderly waiver;</p>
          <p>(3) the estimated annual cost of elderly waiver recipients receiving support under housing support under chapter 256I;</p>
          <p>(4) the estimated annual cost of increased case load of individuals receiving services under the alternative care program;</p>
          <p>(5) the annual loss of license surcharge payments on closed beds;</p>
          <p>(6) the savings from not paying planned closure rate adjustments that the facilities would otherwise be eligible for under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256R.40">256R.40</a>; and</p>
          <p>(7) the savings from not paying external fixed costs payment rate adjustments from submission of renovation costs that would otherwise be eligible as threshold projects under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.434#stat.256B.434.4f">256B.434, subdivision 4f</a>.</p>
          <p>(c) For purposes of the calculation in paragraph (a), clause (3), the estimated medical assistance resident days of the remaining facility or facilities shall be computed assuming 95 percent occupancy multiplied by the historical percentage of medical assistance resident days of the remaining facility or facilities, as reported on the facility's or facilities' most recent nursing facility statistical and cost report filed before the plan of closure is submitted, multiplied by 365.</p>
          <p>(d) For purposes of net cost of savings to the state in paragraph (b), the average occupancy percentages will be those reported on the facility's or facilities' most recent nursing facility statistical and cost report filed before the plan of closure is submitted, and the average payment rates shall be calculated based on the approved payment rates in effect at the time the consolidation request is submitted.</p>
          <p>(e) To qualify for the external fixed costs payment rate adjustment under this subdivision, the closing facilities shall:</p>
          <p>(1) submit an application for closure according to section <a href="/statutes/cite/256R.40#stat.256R.40.2">256R.40, subdivision 2</a>; and</p>
          <p>(2) follow the resident relocation provisions of section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.161">144A.161</a>.</p>
          <p>(f) The county or counties in which a facility or facilities are closed under this subdivision shall not be eligible for designation as a hardship area under subdivision 3 for five years from the date of the approval of the proposed consolidation. The applicant shall notify the county of this limitation and the county shall acknowledge this in a letter of support.</p>

          <p>(a) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1985, the commissioner, by permanent rule, shall reimburse nursing facility providers that are vendors in the medical assistance program for the rental use of real estate and depreciable equipment. "Real estate" means land improvements, buildings, and attached fixtures used directly for resident care. "Depreciable equipment" means the standard movable resident care equipment and support service equipment generally used in long-term care facilities.</p>
          <p>(b) In developing the method for determining payment rates for the rental use of nursing facilities, the commissioner shall consider factors designed to:</p>
          <p>(1) simplify the administrative procedures for determining payment rates for property-related costs;</p>
          <p>(2) minimize discretionary or appealable decisions;</p>
          <p>(3) eliminate any incentives to sell nursing facilities;</p>
          <p>(4) recognize legitimate costs of preserving and replacing property;</p>
          <p>(5) recognize the existing costs of outstanding indebtedness allowable under the statutes and rules in effect on May 1, 1983;</p>
          <p>(6) address the current value of, if used directly for patient care, land improvements, buildings, attached fixtures, and equipment;</p>
          <p>(7) establish an investment per bed limitation;</p>
          <p>(8) reward efficient management of capital assets;</p>
          <p>(9) provide equitable treatment of facilities;</p>
          <p>(10) consider a variable rate; and</p>
          <p>(11) phase-in implementation of the rental reimbursement method.</p>
          <p>(c) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1987, a nursing facility which has reduced licensed bed capacity after January 1, 1986, shall be allowed to:</p>
          <p>(1) aggregate the applicable investment per bed limits based on the number of beds licensed prior to the reduction; and</p>
          <p>(2) establish capacity days for each rate year following the licensure reduction based on the number of beds licensed on the previous April 1 if the commissioner is notified of the change by April 4. The notification must include a copy of the delicensure request that has been submitted to the commissioner of health.</p>
          <p>(d) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1989, the interest expense that results from a refinancing of a nursing facility's demand call loan, when the loan that must be refinanced was incurred before May 22, 1983, is an allowable interest expense if:</p>
          <p>(1) the demand call loan or any part of it was in the form of a loan that was callable at the demand of the lender;</p>
          <p>(2) the demand call loan or any part of it was called by the lender through no fault of the nursing facility;</p>
          <p>(3) the demand call loan or any part of it was made by a government agency operating under a statutory or regulatory loan program;</p>
          <p>(4) the refinanced debt does not exceed the sum of the allowable remaining balance of the demand call loan at the time of payment on the demand call loan and refinancing costs;</p>
          <p>(5) the term of the refinanced debt does not exceed the remaining term of the demand call loan, had the debt not been subject to an on-call payment demand; and</p>
          <p>(6) the refinanced debt is not a debt between related organizations as defined in Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0020">9549.0020</a>, subpart 38.</p>

          <h3 class="headnote">Property costs after July 1, 1988.</h3>
          <p class="in">(a) For the rate year beginning July 1, 1988, the replacement-cost-new per bed limit must be $32,571 per licensed bed in multiple bedrooms and $48,857 per licensed bed in a single bedroom. For the rate year beginning July 1, 1989, the replacement-cost-new per bed limit for a single bedroom must be $49,907 adjusted according to Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, subpart 4, item A, subitem (1). Beginning January 1, 1990, the replacement-cost-new per bed limits must be adjusted annually as specified in Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, subpart 4, item A, subitem (1). Beginning January 1, 1991, the replacement-cost-new per bed limits will be adjusted annually as specified in Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, subpart 4, item A, subitem (1), except that the index utilized will be the Bureau of Economic Analysis: Price Indexes for Private Fixed Investments in Structures; Special Care.</p>
          <p class="in">(b) For the rate year beginning July 1, 1988, the commissioner shall increase the rental factor as established in Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, subpart 8, item A, by 6.2 percent rounded to the nearest 100th percent for the purpose of reimbursing nursing facilities for soft costs and entrepreneurial profits not included in the cost valuation services used by the state's contracted appraisers. For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1989, the rental factor is the amount determined under this paragraph for the rate year beginning July 1, 1988.</p>
          <p class="in">(c) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1988, in order to determine property-related payment rates under Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, for all nursing facilities except those whose average length of stay in a skilled level of care within a nursing facility is 180 days or less, the commissioner shall use 95 percent of capacity days. For a nursing facility whose average length of stay in a skilled level of care within a nursing facility is 180 days or less, the commissioner shall use the greater of resident days or 80 percent of capacity days but in no event shall the divisor exceed 95 percent of capacity days.</p>
          <p class="in">(d) For rate years beginning on July 1, 1988, and July 1, 1989, the commissioner shall add ten cents per resident per day to each nursing facility's property-related payment rate. The ten-cent property-related payment rate increase is not cumulative from rate year to rate year. For the rate year beginning July 1, 1990, the commissioner shall increase each nursing facility's equipment allowance as established in Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, subpart 10, by ten cents per resident per day. For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1991, the adjusted equipment allowance must be adjusted annually for inflation as in Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, subpart 10, item E. For the rate period beginning October 1, 1992, the equipment allowance for each nursing facility shall be increased by 28 percent. For rate years beginning after June 30, 1993, the allowance must be adjusted annually for inflation.</p>
          <p class="in">(e) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1990, Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, subpart 5, item E, shall not apply to outstanding related organization debt incurred prior to May 23, 1983, provided that the debt was an allowable debt under Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/?id=9510.0010">9510.0010</a> to <a href="/rules/?id=9510.0480">9510.0480</a>, the debt is subject to repayment through annual principal payments, and the nursing facility demonstrates to the commissioner's satisfaction that the interest rate on the debt was less than market interest rates for similar arm's-length transactions at the time the debt was incurred. If the debt was incurred due to a sale between family members, the nursing facility must also demonstrate that the seller no longer participates in the management or operation of the nursing facility. Debts meeting the conditions of this paragraph are subject to all other provisions of Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0010">9549.0010</a> to <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0080">9549.0080</a>.</p>
          <p class="in">(f) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1990, a nursing facility with operating lease costs incurred for the nursing facility's buildings shall receive its building capital allowance computed in accordance with Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, subpart 8. If an operating lease provides that the lessee's rent is adjusted to recognize improvements made by the lessor and related debt, the costs for capital improvements and related debt shall be allowed in the computation of the lessee's building capital allowance, provided that reimbursement for these costs under an operating lease shall not exceed the rate otherwise paid.</p>

          <h3 class="headnote">Property costs after July 1, 1990, for certain facilities.</h3>
          <p>(a) For rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1990, nursing facilities that, on or after January 1, 1976, but prior to January 1, 1987, were newly licensed after new construction, or increased their licensed beds by a minimum of 35 percent through new construction, and whose building capital allowance is less than their allowable annual principal and interest on allowable debt prior to the application of the replacement-cost-new per bed limit and whose remaining weighted average debt amortization schedule as of January 1, 1988, exceeded 15 years, must receive a property-related payment rate equal to the greater of their rental per diem or their annual allowable principal and allowable interest without application of the replacement-cost-new per bed limit, divided by their capacity days as determined under Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, subpart 11, as modified by subdivision 3f, paragraph (c), for the preceding reporting year, plus their equipment allowance. A nursing facility that is eligible for a property-related payment rate under this subdivision and whose property-related payment rate in a subsequent rate year is its rental per diem must continue to have its property-related payment rates established for all future rate years based on the rental reimbursement method in Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>.</p>
          <p class="bl">The commissioner may require the nursing facility to apply for refinancing as a condition of receiving special rate treatment under this subdivision.</p>
          <p>(b) If a nursing facility is eligible for a property-related payment rate under this subdivision, and the nursing facility's debt is refinanced after October 1, 1988, the provisions in paragraphs (1) to (7) also apply to the property-related payment rate for rate years beginning on or after July 1, 1990.</p>
          <p>(1) A nursing facility's refinancing must not include debts with balloon payments.</p>
          <p>(2) If the issuance costs, including issuance costs on the debt refinanced, are financed as part of the refinancing, the historical cost of capital assets limit in Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, subpart 5, item A, subitem (6), includes issuance costs that do not exceed seven percent of the debt refinanced, plus the related issuance costs. For purposes of this paragraph, issuance costs means the fees charged by the underwriter, issuer, attorneys, bond raters, appraisers, and trustees, and includes the cost of printing, title insurance, registration tax, and a feasibility study for the refinancing of a nursing facility's debt. Issuance costs do not include bond premiums or discounts when bonds are sold at other than their par value, points, or a bond reserve fund. To the extent otherwise allowed under this paragraph, the straight-line amortization of the refinancing issuance costs is not an allowable cost.</p>
          <p>(3) The annual principal and interest expense payments and any required annual municipal fees on the nursing facility's refinancing replace those of the refinanced debt and, together with annual principal and interest payments on other allowable debts, are allowable costs subject to the limitation on historical cost of capital assets plus issuance costs as limited in paragraph (2), if any.</p>
          <p>(4) If the nursing facility's refinancing includes zero coupon bonds, the commissioner shall establish a monthly debt service payment schedule based on an annuity that will produce an amount equal to the zero coupon bonds at maturity. The term and interest rate is the term and interest rate of the zero coupon bonds. Any refinancing to repay the zero coupon bonds is not an allowable cost.</p>
          <p>(5) The annual amount of annuity payments is added to the nursing facility's allowable annual principal and interest payment computed in paragraph (3).</p>
          <p>(6) The property-related payment rate is equal to the amount in paragraph (5), divided by the nursing facility's capacity days as determined under Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, subpart 11, as modified by subdivision 3f, paragraph (c), for the preceding reporting year plus an equipment allowance.</p>

          <p>For rate years beginning after June 30, 1993, if a nursing facility acquires capital assets in connection with a project approved under the moratorium exception process in section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.073">144A.073</a> or in connection with an addition to or replacement of buildings, attached fixtures, or land improvements for which the total historical cost of those capital asset additions exceeds the lesser of $150,000 or ten percent of the most recent appraised value, the nursing facility shall be eligible for an equity incentive payment rate as in paragraphs (a) to (d). This computation is separate from the determination of the nursing facility's rental rate. An equity incentive payment rate as computed under this subdivision is limited to one in a 12-month period.</p>
          <p>(a) An eligible nursing facility shall receive an equity incentive payment rate equal to the allowable historical cost of the capital asset acquired, minus the allowable debt directly identified to that capital asset, multiplied by the equity incentive factor as described in paragraphs (b) and (c), and divided by the nursing facility's occupancy factor under subdivision 3f, paragraph (c). This amount shall be added to the nursing facility's total payment rate and shall be effective the same day as the incremental increase in paragraph (d) or subdivision 17. The allowable historical cost of the capital assets and the allowable debt shall be determined as provided in Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0010">9549.0010</a> to <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0080">9549.0080</a>, and this section.</p>

          <p>(1) divide the initial allowable debt in paragraph (a) by the initial historical cost of the capital asset additions referred to in paragraph (a), then cube the quotient,</p>
          <p>(2) subtract the amount calculated in clause (1) from the number one,</p>
          <p>(3) determine the difference between the rental factor and the lesser of two percentage points above the posted yield for standard conventional fixed rate mortgages of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation as published in the Wall Street Journal and in effect on the first day of the month the debt or cost is incurred, or 16 percent,</p>
          <p>(4) multiply the amount calculated in clause (2) by the amount calculated in clause (3).</p>
          <p>(c) The equity incentive payment rate shall be limited to the term of the allowable debt in paragraph (a), not greater than 20 years nor less than ten years. If no debt is incurred in acquiring the capital asset, the equity incentive payment rate shall be paid for ten years. The sale of a nursing facility under subdivision 14 shall terminate application of the equity incentive payment rate effective on the date provided in subdivision 14, paragraph (f), for the sale.</p>
          <p>(d) A nursing facility with an addition to or a renovation of its buildings, attached fixtures, or land improvements meeting the criteria in this subdivision and not receiving the property-related payment rate adjustment in subdivision 17, shall receive the incremental increase in the nursing facility's rental rate as determined under Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0010">9549.0010</a> to <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0080">9549.0080</a>, and this section.

          <p>(3) establish capacity days based on the number of beds immediately prior to the delicensure and the number of beds after the delicensure.</p>
          <p class="in">The commissioner shall increase the facility's property payment rate by the incremental increase in the rental per diem resulting from the recalculation of the facility's rental per diem applying only the changes resulting from the delicensure of beds and clauses (1), (2), and (3). If a facility reimbursed under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.434">256B.434</a> completes a moratorium exception project after its base year, the base year property rate shall be the moratorium project property rate. The base year rate shall be inflated by the factors in section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.434#stat.256B.434.4">256B.434, subdivision 4</a>, paragraph (c).

          <p>(g) A nursing facility receiving a rate adjustment as a result of this section shall comply with section <a href="/statutes/cite/256R.06#stat.256R.06.5">256R.06, subdivision 5</a>.</p>
          <p>(h) A facility that does not utilize the space made available as a result of bed layaway or delicensure under this subdivision to reduce the number of beds per room or provide more common space for nursing facility uses or perform other activities related to the operation of the nursing facility shall have its property rate increase calculated under this subdivision reduced by the ratio of the square footage made available that is not used for these purposes to the total square footage made available as a result of bed layaway or delicensure.</p>

Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, the definitions, rate calculation methods, and principles in sections <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.071">144A.071</a> and <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a> and Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0010">9549.0010</a> to <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0080">9549.0080</a>, shall be used to calculate rate adjustments for allowable construction projects under this subdivision and section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.073">144A.073</a>. Facilities completing construction projects between October 1, 2005, and October 1, 2006, are eligible to have a property rate adjustment effective October 1, 2006.

Facilities completing projects after January 1, 2018, are eligible for a property rate adjustment effective on the first day of the month of January or July, whichever occurs immediately following the completion date.</p>
          <p>(b) Notwithstanding subdivision 18, as of July 14, 2005, facilities with rates set under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a> and Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0010">9549.0010</a> to <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0080">9549.0080</a>, that commenced a construction project on or after October 1, 2004, and do not have a contract under subdivision 3 by September 30, 2006, are eligible to request a rate adjustment under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a>, subdivision 10, through September 30, 2006. If the request results in the commissioner determining a rate adjustment is allowable, the rate adjustment is effective on the first of the month following project completion. These facilities shall be allowed to accumulate construction project costs for the period October 1, 2004, to September 30, 2006.</p>
          <p>(c) Facilities shall be allowed construction project rate adjustments no sooner than 12 months after completing a previous construction project. Facilities must request the rate adjustment according to section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a>, subdivision 10.</p>
          <p>(d) Capacity days shall be computed according to Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, subpart 11. For rate calculations under this section, the number of licensed beds in the nursing facility shall be the number existing after the construction project is completed and the number of days in the nursing facility's reporting period shall be 365.</p>
          <p>(e) The value of assets to be recognized for a total replacement project as defined in section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a>, subdivision 17d, shall be computed as described in clause (1). The value of assets to be recognized for all other projects shall be computed as described in clause (2).</p>

If a facility's current request for a rate adjustment results from the completion of a construction project that was previously approved under section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.073">144A.073</a>, the assets to be used in the rate calculation cannot exceed the lesser of the amount determined under sections <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.071">144A.071</a>, subdivision 2, and <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.073">144A.073</a>, subdivision 3b, or the actual allowable costs of the construction project. A current request that is not the result of a project under section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.073">144A.073</a> cannot exceed the limit under section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.071">144A.071</a>, subdivision 2, paragraph (a). Applicable credits must be deducted from the cost of the construction project.</p>
          <p>(2)(i) Replacement-cost-new limits under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a>, subdivision 17e, and the number of beds allowed under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a>, subdivision 3a, paragraph (c), shall be used to compute the maximum amount of assets allowable in a facility's property rate calculation.</p>
          <p>(ii) The value of a facility's assets to be compared to the amount in item (i) begins with the total appraised value from the last rate notice a facility received when its rates were set under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a> and Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0010">9549.0010</a> to <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0080">9549.0080</a>. This value shall be indexed by the factor in section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a>, subdivision 3f, paragraph (a), for each rate year the facility received an inflation factor on its property-related rate when its rates were set under this section. The value of assets listed as previous capital additions, capital additions, and special projects on the facility's base year rate notice and the value of assets related to a construction project for which the facility received a rate adjustment when its rates were determined under this section shall be added to the indexed appraised value.</p>
          <p>(iii) The maximum amount of assets to be recognized in computing a facility's rate adjustment after a project is completed is the lesser of the aggregate replacement-cost-new limit computed in (i) minus the assets recognized in (ii) or the actual allowable costs of the construction project.</p>
          <p>(iv) If a facility's current request for a rate adjustment results from the completion of a construction project that was previously approved under section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.073">144A.073</a>, the assets to be added to the rate calculation cannot exceed the lesser of the amount determined under sections <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.071">144A.071</a>, subdivision 2, and <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.073">144A.073</a>, subdivision 3b, or the actual allowable costs of the construction project. A current request that is not the result of a project under section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.073">144A.073</a> cannot exceed the limit stated in section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.071">144A.071</a>, subdivision 2, paragraph (a). Assets disposed of as a result of a construction project and applicable credits must be deducted from the cost of the construction project.</p>
          <p>(f) For construction projects approved under section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.073">144A.073</a>, allowable debt may never exceed the lesser of the cost of the assets purchased, the threshold limit in section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.071">144A.071</a>, subdivision 2, or the replacement-cost-new limit less previously existing capital debt.</p>
          <p>(g) For construction projects that were not approved under section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.073">144A.073</a>, allowable debt is limited to the lesser of the threshold in section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.071">144A.071</a>, subdivision 2, for such construction projects or the applicable limit in paragraph (e), clause (1) or (2), less previously existing capital debt. Amounts of debt taken out that exceed the costs of a construction project shall not be allowed regardless of the use of the funds.</p>
          <p>For all construction projects being recognized, interest expense and average debt shall be computed based on the first 12 months following project completion. "Previously existing capital debt" means capital debt recognized on the last rate determined under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a> and Minnesota Rules, parts <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0010">9549.0010</a> to <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0080">9549.0080</a>, and the amount of debt recognized for a construction project for which the facility received a rate adjustment when its rates were determined under this section.</p>
          <p>For a total replacement project as defined in section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a>, subdivision 17d, the value of previously existing capital debt shall be zero.</p>
          <p>(h) In addition to the interest expense allowed from the application of paragraph (f), the amounts allowed under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a>, subdivision 17a, paragraph (a), clauses (2) and (3), will be added to interest expense.</p>
          <p>(i) The equity portion of the construction project shall be computed as the allowable assets in paragraph (e), less the average debt in paragraph (f). The equity portion must be multiplied by 5.66 percent and the allowable interest expense in paragraph (f) must be added. This sum must be divided by 95 percent of capacity days to compute the construction project rate adjustment.</p>
          <p>(j) For projects that are not a total replacement of a nursing facility, the amount in paragraph (i) is adjusted for nonreimbursable areas and then added to the current property payment rate of the facility.</p>
          <p>(k) For projects that are a total replacement of a nursing facility, the amount in paragraph (i) becomes the new property payment rate after being adjusted for nonreimbursable areas. Any amounts existing in a facility's rate before the effective date of the construction project for equity incentives under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a>, subdivision 16; capital repairs and replacements under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a>, subdivision 15; or refinancing incentives under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a>, subdivision 19, shall be removed from the facility's rates.</p>
          <p>(l) No additional equipment allowance is allowed under Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=9549.0060">9549.0060</a>, subpart 10, as the result of construction projects under this section. Allowable equipment shall be included in the construction project costs.</p>
          <p>(m) Capital assets purchased after the completion date of a construction project shall be counted as construction project costs for any future rate adjustment request made by a facility under section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.071">144A.071</a>, subdivision 2, clause (a), if they are purchased within 24 months of the completion of the future construction project.</p>
          <p>(n) In subsequent rate years, the property payment rate for a facility that results from the application of this subdivision shall be the amount inflated in subdivision 4.</p>
          <p>(o) Construction projects are eligible for an equity incentive under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a>, subdivision 16. When computing the equity incentive for a construction project under this subdivision, only the allowable costs and allowable debt related to the construction project shall be used. The equity incentive shall not be a part of the property payment rate and not inflated under subdivision 4. Effective October 1, 2006, all equity incentives for nursing facilities reimbursed under this section shall be allowed for a duration determined under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256B.431">256B.431</a>, subdivision 16, paragraph (c).</p>

          <p>In reviewing and approving closure proposals, the commissioner shall consider, but not be limited to, the following criteria:</p>
          <p>(1) improved quality of care and quality of life for consumers;</p>
          <p>(2) closure of a nursing facility that has a poor physical plant;</p>
          <p>(3) the existence of excess nursing facility beds, measured in terms of beds per thousand persons aged 85 or older. The excess must be measured in reference to:</p>
          <p>(i) the county in which the facility is located. A facility in a county that is in the lowest quartile of counties with reference to beds per thousand persons aged 85 or older is not in an area of excess capacity;</p>
          <p>(ii) the county and all contiguous counties;</p>
          <p>(iii) the region in which the facility is located; or</p>
          <p>(iv) the facility's service area. The facility shall indicate in its application the service area it believes is appropriate for this measurement;</p>
          <p>(4) low-occupancy rates, provided that the unoccupied beds are not the result of a personnel shortage. In analyzing occupancy rates, the commissioner shall examine waiting lists in the applicant facility and at facilities in the surrounding area, as determined under clause (3);</p>
          <p>(5) evidence of coordination between the community planning process and the facility application. If the planning group does not support a level of nursing facility closures that the commissioner considers to be reasonable, the commissioner may approve a planned closure proposal without its support;</p>
          <p>(6) proposed usage of funds available from a planned closure rate adjustment for care-related purposes;</p>
          <p>(7) innovative use planned for the closed facility's physical plant;</p>
          <p>(8) evidence that the proposal serves the interests of the state; and</p>
          <p>(9) evidence of other factors that affect the viability of the facility, including excessive nursing pool costs.</p>

          <p>(a) The commissioner shall calculate the amount of the planned closure rate adjustment available under subdivision 6 according to clauses (1) to (4):</p>
          <p>(1) the amount available is the net reduction of nursing facility beds multiplied by $2,080;</p>
          <p>(2) the total number of beds in the nursing facility or facilities receiving the planned closure rate adjustment must be identified;</p>
          <p>(3) capacity days are determined by multiplying the number determined under clause (2) by 365; and</p>
          <p>(4) the planned closure rate adjustment is the amount available in clause (1), divided by capacity days determined under clause (3).</p>
          <p>(b) A planned closure rate adjustment under this section is effective on the first day of the month of January or July, whichever occurs immediately following completion of closure of the facility designated for closure in the application and becomes part of the nursing facility's external fixed payment rate.</p>
          <p>(c) Upon the request of a closing facility, the commissioner must allow the facility a closure rate adjustment as provided under section <a href="/statutes/cite/144A.161#stat.144A.161.10">144A.161, subdivision 10</a>.</p>
          <p>(d) A facility that has received a planned closure rate adjustment may reassign it to another facility that is under the same ownership at any time within three years of its effective date. The amount of the adjustment is computed according to paragraph (a).</p>
          <p>(e) If the per bed dollar amount specified in paragraph (a), clause (1), is increased, the commissioner shall recalculate planned closure rate adjustments for facilities that delicense beds under this section on or after July 1, 2001, to reflect the increase in the per bed dollar amount.

          <p>A facility or facilities reimbursed under this chapter with a closure plan approved by the commissioner under subdivision 4 may assign a planned closure rate adjustment to another facility or facilities that are not closing or in the case of a partial closure, to the facility undertaking the partial closure. A facility may also elect to have a planned closure rate adjustment shared equally by the five nursing facilities with the lowest total operating payment rates in the state development region designated under section <a href="/statutes/cite/462.385">462.385</a>, in which the facility that is closing is located. The planned closure rate adjustment must be calculated under subdivision 5. Facilities that delicense beds without a closure plan, or whose closure plan is not approved by the commissioner, are not eligible to assign a planned closure rate adjustment under subdivision 5, unless they: (1) are delicensing five or fewer beds, or less than six percent of their total licensed bed capacity, whichever is greater; (2) are located in a county in the top three quartiles of beds per 1,000 persons aged 65 or older; and (3) have not delicensed beds in the prior three months. Facilities meeting these criteria are eligible to assign the amount calculated under subdivision 5 to themselves. If a facility is delicensing the greater of six or more beds, or six percent or more of its total licensed bed capacity, and does not have an approved closure plan or is not eligible for the adjustment under subdivision 5, the commissioner shall calculate the amount the facility would have been eligible to assign under subdivision 5, and shall use this amount to provide equal rate adjustments to the five nursing facilities with the lowest total operating payment rates in the state development region designated under section <a href="/statutes/cite/462.385">462.385</a>, in which the facility that delicensed beds is located.</p>

        <p>(a) Beginning July 1, 2005, the operating payment rate for nursing facilities reimbursed under this chapter shall be increased by 20 percent multiplied by the ratio of the number of new single-bed rooms created divided by the number of active beds on July 1, 2005, for each bed closure that results in the creation of a single-bed room after July 1, 2005. The commissioner may implement rate adjustments for up to 3,000 new single-bed rooms each year. For eligible bed closures for which the commissioner receives a notice from a facility that a bed has been delicensed and a new single-bed room has been established, the rate adjustment in this paragraph shall be effective on either the first day of the month of January or July, whichever occurs first following the date of the bed delicensure.</p>
        <p>(b) A nursing facility is prohibited from discharging residents for purposes of establishing single-bed rooms. A nursing facility must submit documentation to the commissioner in a form prescribed by the commissioner, certifying the occupancy status of beds closed to create single-bed rooms. In the event that the commissioner determines that a facility has discharged a resident for purposes of establishing a single-bed room, the commissioner shall not provide a rate adjustment under paragraph (a).</p>
