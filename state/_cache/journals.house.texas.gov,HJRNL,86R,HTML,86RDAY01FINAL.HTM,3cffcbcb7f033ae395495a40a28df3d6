In history, when Cabeza de Vaca came to Texas from the Gulf, he saw a great river. He named it "los brazos de Dios," the Brazos, the arms of God. We place our state in your arms, O God. Keep us safe. We thank you, how through floods and hardship you have used others to extend your arms to help families get back on their feet. Bless all the families of our state. We especially intercede for those who have suffered any tragedy and are grieving. We thank you for your providence, providing for our people, providing employment. Keep sustaining our economy. Also, we want to pray for all the children of our state as they start the school semester. Please watch over them.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Through your son, Jesus, you said, but he that is the greatest among you shall be your servant. We thank you for these men and women who are public servants, who take a break from their day-to-day jobs to better our state. Protect them and bless their families. Also today, Lord, I ask you to bless those who are new to this chamber and are newly elected. As they go through this transition, be with them and give them peace. As Psalm 127 says, if the Lord does not build a house, in vain do the builders labor. Bless this house. Thanks for the freedom we had to vote these people into office. Help each of these representatives, Lord, with an outpouring of your spirit. Enlighten them with the gifts of counsel and wisdom. Give them fortitude and courage. Unite them in a sincere desire for the common good. Let the sense of true justice and charity guide them and a respect for all the people of our state since you created each one of us in your own image and likeness. Prosper the work of their hands. Bless these days ahead and journey along beside them. Bless our governor, and bless our nation of which we are a part. Let Texas continue to be a blessing to these United States of America. Amen.</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">The Secretary recognized Abby Price, daughter of the Honorable Four Price, Heather Lewis, Chris Truong, and Michael Follis, students from the Butler School of Music at The University of Texas, who sang the national anthem.</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">The Secretary recognized the Honorable Dan Flynn of Van Zandt County who led the House in the pledge of allegiance to the United States flag.

I won't keep you long, I promise. I want to extend a special welcome to my wife and to families, friends, and special guests. Thank you all for joining us, and thank you for the sacrifices you've made to be with us today. I'd also like to thank Governor Abbott for his leadership and for giving me the opportunity to serve as Texas' 112th Secretary of State.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">To new and returning members: Congratulations on being here today, and thank you for your dedication to public service. I trust you will all make your constituents proud during this 140-day journey. Each one of you is expected to rise to the challenge of addressing issues that face Texans in their everyday lives and to do so in a way that is uniquely Texan: with honor, integrity, strength, and with our Texas pride. You must always bear in mind that the decisions you make impact not only your lives but also the lives of your fellow Texans, and your priorities must always be with them. As Texas Secretary of State, my principal duty and my priority is to protect the integrity of our most sacred institution, the electoral process. But this responsibility is not mine alone. As a state, we rely on officials in each of Texas' 254&nbsp;counties---from Harris to Hudspeth, Dallas to Dickens, and Bexar to Borden. And whether it's a local, state, or national election, our county officials are at the vanguard of defending our democratic process. I would like to extend a hand in partnership and offer the secretary of state's office as a steadfast resource as we continue to work together to protect and preserve our most cherished civic institution. Our democracy is only as strong as the electoral process that maintains it, and I look forward to working with all of you to make it even stronger.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">It's also important to remember that ensuring we have a prosperous future means we need to continue to cultivate strong relationships with our international partners. Not only is Texas the top exporting state in the nation, but we've also received a top ranking for foreign direct investment in the nation. Our economy is larger than that of many global superpowers, and steering it is no easy task. The incredible responsibility of keeping Texas a global leader falls to all of us as servants to the people of the Lone Star State. And today, the people of Texas put trust in you to secure the prosperous future that Texas has always and will always deserve. I know you're up to the challenge. Thank you for your service. God bless you, good luck, and may God forever bestow a special blessing on the great State of Texas.</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:0em;line-height:120%;text-align:center;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em"><b>APPOINTMENT OF TEMPORARY OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES</b></div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">The Secretary announced the appointment of temporary officers and employees for the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Sixth Legislature of the State of Texas.</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:0em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Parliamentarians<div class="spaceFill" type="Dot"></div>Sharon Carter and Hugh L.

Members, as we begin the 86th legislative session, let us reflect on the fact that Texans from all corners of the state, all walks of life, have entrusted each of us to craft policy that will improve the lives of all Texans, to help our districts be heard and accomplish their agenda, and to do this in a very short 140 days. Members, this session, Texans expect and should expect us to pass meaningful school finance reform and lessen the huge burden of property taxes for homeowners. And these big issues transcend the divides of party, ideology, and even geography.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">On this, the first day of the 86th session, the question we have to ask is, will we do it? And I predict at the end of 140 days, the answer is, absolutely yes, because we are the Texas House---the greatest legislative body in the entire country. However, in order to be successful, we need a speaker who will let the body work to realize its fullest potential, to let members represent their districts, and to stand up for the house. That is why I rise today to nominate a speaker that the Texas House deserves, Dennis Bonnen.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Dennis was drafted into this speaker's race not just because of his list of qualifications, which are plentiful, but because of his character and his vision for the house. Dennis is someone who respects the members by telling us the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Dennis is willing to jump into the arena and fight for what is right to build consensus. He doesn't wait on the sidelines to see which way the political winds are blowing. Time and time again, I have seen Dennis give voice to what is right without regard for how powerful the other side might be. Most importantly, he deeply respects this chamber and believes every member must be allowed to fully represent their district.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Let me close with this. Texas needs the house to lead this session. We need a speaker with the strength and tenacity to let that happen. It is for these reasons and so many more that I nominate my good friend Dennis Bonnen to be the next speaker of the house, a speaker for the entire house.</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">The Secretary recognized the Honorable Senfronia Thompson of Harris County, who seconded the nomination of the Honorable Dennis Bonnen, speaking as follows:</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Mr. Secretary, Mr. Chief Justice, fellow members, and distinguished guests, today I'm honored to stand here in the people's house to nominate Representative Dennis Bonnen to serve as the next speaker of the people's house. It has been my distinct privilege to serve under six speakers. I'm eager for Dennis Bonnen to be my lucky number seven. </div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">In my 45 years serving in the Texas House, I've witnessed all kinds of politics. You know during those 45 years, I've witnessed all kinds of people. I've seen tremendous triumphs and devastating defeats. But the one thing that I've seen remain constant through all of this is the house works best when we work together. We come into this building as many different people from many different backgrounds. Each and every one of us carries dreams and ambitions. Some of those dreams are our own. That's the reason why we were on the ballots. Some of those dreams we carry on behalf of our constituents, holding their future and their children's future within each of what we can accomplish. But I cannot visualize those dreams, nor can you, alone. None of us could. Here in this chamber, every woman and man can and should have the opportunity to work with one another, to serve together, to discuss and debate together the dreams we bring into this chamber. We do our best work when we set aside our differences and find common ground. When we work together and when we are empowered to serve our districts, we succeed.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Representative Bonnen knows this. In his 22 years of experience, he has learned the ins and the outs of the Texas House as well as anyone I've ever served with. As speaker, I can assure you that he would be committed first and foremost to helping us realize our dreams, to realize our potentials. I know this because he told me, and Dennis is a man who keeps his word. When Dennis says he wants the house to be united, I trust him. When he says he wants to reduce the partisan bickering that has at times plagued this floor in recent years, I trust him. When he says he wants to put school finance and the dreams we all carry for our children front and center this session, I trust him.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Dennis has fought his entire life and especially his entire legislative career with intelligence and determination. He has work ethics as long and as proud as Texas. And he wants to make sure that everyone---no matter who you are, where you came from, or why you're here---he wants everyone that works hard and fights fair to have every chance to succeed. Dennis will be a fighter and a champion for this house. That's why I'm so proud to nominate him and to lend him support to lead this house and to serve as the next speaker of the Texas House of Representatives.</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">The Secretary recognized the Honorable Matt Krause of Tarrant County, who seconded the nomination of the Honorable Dennis Bonnen, speaking as follows:</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Good afternoon, colleagues. It's so incredible to be back here with you, and I know each of you who got sworn in would know that you would not be here without a support structure from home. I'm no different, so I want to publicly thank my amazing wife, Jenny, and our incredible kids, Jeremiah, Hannah Sue, James, Gracie, and Ruthie for the support and sacrifice you've given me and will continue to give the next 140 days.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">On November 12, Dennis Bonnen called a press conference, and at that press conference he said, "The speaker's race is over." And he unveiled a list of 109&nbsp;names, way more than the 76&nbsp;he needed. In those two months we got kind of a window into how Representative Bonnen, soon to be Speaker Bonnen, will operate. There's two key aspects I want to look at. One was, right after that press conference he announced a working group to select the next parliamentarian. This is a very private decision for the speaker. As far as we know, in Texas history, this has never been done before, to allow members to have input on who the next parliamentarian should be. And so we appointed five republicans and five democrats. But it wasn't just that he had numbers from equal parties, it was who those republicans and democrats were. They showed a great cross section of the house. Every line of the political spectrum was represented there, and he even had individuals who were not on that list of 109&nbsp;supporters that he had listed the day before. He made a great decision, and then he made another great decision by having Four Price and Joe Moody co-chair that committee, two of the hardest working and brightest members we have in this house today, and they did an amazing job during that process. It spoke volumes of Representative Bonnen that he would bring the membership in and allow them to have input on this very important decision.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Then he was in Tyler a few weeks after that, meeting with some members, and the press asked, "What does a Speaker Bonnen administration look like?" And he said, "You know what? My job is to level the playing field, make sure every member is heard, not that they necessarily win the day, but that they have a chance to win the day." And I think that's all you can ask from a speaker, and really all you want from a speaker is to level the playing field and allow the members to represent their districts. And as a part of that, they said, "Well, what's your school finance plan?" He said, "That's the great thing about being speaker. I don't need a school finance plan. My job is to empower the members and get them in a room till we discuss and figure out what's going to happen." And I love that, because we're going to take on some issues that have vexed prior legislatures, right---big ticket items---and we're going to need somebody like him leading us through that.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Those past legislatures, we shouldn't forget their successes and failures. In fact, somebody told me, use the past. Use their hindsight as your foresight as you look for insight into what to do next. And I am confident by learning the lessons of the past, with the cooperation, unity, and hard work of the present, we can ensure a much brighter Texas future. That's why I'm so optimistic about Representative Bonnen. He's one of the rare individuals I've ever known who has a 30,000-foot view, gets the big picture, but can also get into the weeds on policy matters. Some people can do one or two of those things, a couple of people can do both those things, but rarely do you have somebody who can do them both well. He is the leader we need for this time. He's been appointed for such a time as this, and I'm honored to rise today to second the nomination for Dennis Bonnen for Texas Speaker of the House. Let's get to work. God bless you guys.</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">The Secretary recognized the Honorable Mary Gonz&#xE1;lez of El Paso County, who seconded the nomination of the Honorable Dennis Bonnen, speaking as follows:</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">In December 1993, I was 10 years old. In the middle of the night right before Christmas, my dad, who's sitting with me today on the house floor, rushed into my room to get me and my brother out of the house because our house was burning down. That night, my family lost all of our belongings. And as sad as that moment is in my childhood, it was also very transformative, because that night a local farmer came and picked me and my brother up and took care of us. And for the next few months, people from all over the community came and fed us, clothed us, and helped us rebuild our home.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">That moment is the reason that I am here and I work to give back to my community. After serving the last six years, I have learned that we all have stories like mine, the reasons that we serve. I have learned that we all love and care about our districts, our communities, and our state. When I first decided to run for office, my younger brother asked me, "But Mary, why do you want to be a state rep? All politicians are bad." Sadly, the divisions that exist in politics today encourage people to become disenchanted with the political process. Today and for the next 139&nbsp;days---well, hopefully 139 days---we can change this. We have the opportunity to change people's minds about politics and politicians. This session, we can come together to work on school finance, infrastructure, and economic development, and we can demonstrate what working together across differences looks like. Because what we do in this building matters, and we have an opportunity to model true leadership for the state, for the country, and for the younger generation. Do we want the younger generation to grow up in a society with divisions and distrust of their fellow Texans? Or do we want them to grow and to learn in a state that honors and respects everybody?</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">I am lucky that this has been modeled to me my entire life by my father, Alfred Gonz&#xE1;lez. He's my best friend, my mentor, my next-door neighbor, and my favorite and most difficult constituent. To love and respect someone who is the political opposite of me allows me to enter the political space wanting to find common ground. And while he may worry about what his republicans will say about his democratic daughter, at the end of the day he has always shown me love and respect. That is why I am honored today to second the nomination of Chairman Bonnen. Chairman Bonnen shares the same characteristics as my father---a stern, fierce republican with the space in his heart and in his leadership style to treat everyone with respect and fairness regardless of ideology. He creates an environment where each of us can share our stories so we can serve our districts and the state. His tenure in the house will enable him to build a culture where members and our districts come first. I second this nomination not just for our Texas House but for future generations of Texans. May we make our state stronger for them. God bless Texas.</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">The Secretary recognized the Honorable Lyle Larson of Bexar County, who seconded the nomination of the Honorable Dennis Bonnen, speaking as follows:</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">"With all due respect"---how many times have you heard Dennis Bonnen say that on this house floor? "With all due respect"---that is his signature phrase. He's in good company. There's been many an English lord that has used this in parliament when engaged in civil discourse. But there's also, more recently, an American cinema icon, Ricky Bobby. He used it famously in <i>Talladega Nights</i>.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">The first time that Dennis Bonnen imparted his sage advice to me, it was about three weeks into my first session. I had a bill that was going to elect TxDot commissioners, and my legislative director, Emily Eppright, who worked for Dennis Bonnen before, said, you need to go down and talk to Dennis about this bill. So I walked down there and laid out the merits of the bill, trying to convince him that it was a great bill. He listened patiently. Then he sat back in his chair, and he smirked, and he said, "With all due respect, the governor appoints those people, and you don't want to upset the governor, do you?" It was good advice. I probably should've listened a little bit more. He's given counsel to many of us. He talked about policy. He talked about procedure. He talked about political realities. And I don't want him to hear this, but he was about 90&nbsp;percent right on the advice that he gave.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Confucius, the great East Texas philosopher, said, if your plan is one year, you plant rice. If your plan is for 10&nbsp;years, you plant trees. If your plan is for 100&nbsp;years, you educate children. Dennis Bonnen has been training for this position for over two decades, and I truly believe that he will have a multigenerational impact on our state. He's willing to tackle the giants---public school finance; comprehensive property tax relief and reform; water policy, which would include the post-Harvey flood challenges we had; and many other issues. His wit, his intellect, and his procedural genius---it has stirred us. It has entertained us. But most importantly, it has led us through some of the most fierce fights that we've had on this Texas floor over the past decade. He'll be undaunted by any naysayers that rise from this body or across the hall, but he'll guide us with precision and conviction.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">So with all due respect, to anyone that would suggest that Dennis Bonnen shouldn't be our speaker, I submit to you that he will lead us with purpose and with passion like he always has. And that's why it's my honor to nominate him to be the next speaker for the Texas House of Representatives.</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">The Secretary recognized the Honorable Eddie Lucio III of Cameron County, who seconded the nomination of the Honorable Dennis Bonnen, speaking as follows:</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Good afternoon, members and invited guests. It's an honor to stand before you and give the final second nomination of my friend Dennis Bonnen for Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. My first session was in 2007. Right before I came to Austin, I attended a family reunion for my mother-in-law's family in Angleton, Texas. As you know, Dennis is from Angleton. I had the pleasure of meeting Dennis's parents at this party and learned that my in-laws were very close to the Bonnen family---like grew up next door close.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">As luck will have it, my first committee assignment was to serve as vice-chair of Environmental Regulation, a committee that Dennis chaired. The first thing I learned serving on that committee was that you better come prepared. Whether you were a member laying out a bill or a witness testifying, Chairman Bonnen expected you to come fully informed and prepared to deliver honest testimony. See, Dennis works hard and expects people to deliver the same work ethic and intensity as he does. As a small business owner, I can relate to that.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">The perfect example of Dennis's work ethic and commitment to the process can be seen in his work on the border security bill during the 2015 session. That was the key bill of that session and very important to stakeholders in Dennis's party. It would have been easy for him to manage the passage of that bill in a way to maximize the extent to which he appeased only members of his party. Instead, Chairman Bonnen worked tirelessly to craft a piece of legislation that was rooted in stakeholder input. He held countless meetings with members from the border and took seriously all the input they provided. He sought out chiefs of police, sheriffs, and various stakeholders to hear directly from them about the situation on their border. He used what he learned to invest the money of the people of Texas as effectively and meaningfully as possible. That was when I learned what it takes to work and craft a big, comprehensive bill.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">See, people don't go as fast as they can; they go as fast as they are led. And let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, good luck keeping up with Dennis Bonnen. I can provide many examples like this, but I want to share another side of Dennis, a side that the media doesn't see. I was elected at the tender age of 27. Much of my time becoming husband, father, and professional has occurred while serving in the legislature. Serving in the legislature is tough and can take its toll on you mentally and physically. Without knowing, or maybe he did, Dennis personally mentored me throughout this journey. He immediately took an interest in my family. For example, my wife, Jaime---who is here with me today---and I had a scare with one of our pregnancies during a particularly important week a few sessions back. Dennis found me in the hallway and recognized something was wrong, and immediately told me that the most important thing was family. He walked me to my office and out of the Capitol to ensure I went home. Throughout the years, if Dennis recognizes that the emotion of a legislative day has gotten the better of me, he will seek me out and make sure I am okay. Dennis is the person many of us turn to when things get tough between our parties, asking him to forge compromise and keep the decorum of the house intact. He has embodied for me the true meaning of a mentor and friend.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Dennis takes mentorship seriously and has mentored several young people in his district. As tough as he is in Austin, members, there is no one better than him when it comes to relationships and constituency work back home. Today, we have a special guest from Speaker Bonnen's district. With us, we have Pahola Gonz&#xE1;lez. She is a graduate of Brazoswood High School. In 2014, Dennis nominated Pahola for the Texas Armed Services Scholarship Program. This scholarship enabled her to be the first in her family to attend and graduate college. Shortly after graduation from UTSA, Pahola received her commission into the United States Army. Pahola personifies what we want young Texans to achieve. Please help me congratulate and welcome Pahola to the Texas House. </div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Chairman Bonnen, thank you for your mentorship for not only myself, but countless young members, and most importantly for mentoring and caring about the future of the people you serve.

I have so many people to thank today, starting with my wife, Kim. People who spend just a little bit of time with me figure out very quickly that Kim is destined for sainthood. You, Jackson, and Gregory are the center of everything I do. I also want to say hello to my namesake, Uncle Dennis Psoras, who is watching online at his home in Baltimore, Maryland. Thank you, Uncle Denny. Mom, you and dad have given us everything---thank you. Elected leaders and distinguished guests, thank you for being here today. Your presence speaks volumes about the opportunities we have before us. I look forward to working with each one of you. I want to thank my good friend Brian McCall, who has mentored me through this transition. Brian honorably served as a member of the Texas House for almost 20 years and is one of the most honest and upstanding individuals I've ever had the privilege of working with. Thank you, Chancellor McCall.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">I also want to thank Speaker Straus for his leadership in this chamber and his friendship during his tenure and during this transition. And I want to thank Speaker Tom Craddick for his continued service to the State of Texas. He's represented his district for the last 50 years and is the longest-serving member of the Texas House of Representatives in our state's history. He was entering public service just when I was entering the world. Thank you, Speaker Craddick. When I was first elected to the Texas House, Pete Laney led this chamber. He did so with a spirit of bipartisanship and fairness. Thank you, Speaker Laney, for honoring all of us with your presence here today. We're also blessed with another former speaker with us today, Speaker Gib Lewis. He was the first speaker to be elected to the post five times, and I am grateful that he joined us here today. Thank you, Speaker Lewis. It is their leadership of this body that is the foundation on which we stand and from which we will build. I am humbled to have my name mentioned with yours, and I hope to uphold your legacies of leadership. Truthfully, one of my greatest personal moments was being speaker pro tempore and serving in that role as my mentor and great friend did, Tom Uher. I wanted and still want to be just as good a member as Tom was. Through his example, he showed me how to be a good member of the Texas House and how to be a good representative for my constituents. Tom, to say I'm honored doesn't even get there, to have you here with us today. Thank you for all you have done for me, for my family, and thank you for your friendship. You truly are a great American.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">To be very honest, this is a little bit of a weird experience for me. I never dreamed or planned to be in this position. Truthfully, at this point in the ceremony, I'm usually thinking, &#x201C;Man, I hope he doesn't talk too long. Kim was right; I should've eaten before coming to the floor.&#x201D; Every opening day brings with it feelings of excitement to be back with some of my closest friends, fired up at the chance to do something meaningful. Nobody really knows what that feels like except for those of us who were chosen by our communities to serve and sit here today. So right now, I am plenty excited to get rolling. I'm almost as excited as Linda Winder, my high school journalism teacher, neighbor, and former district director. She was the first person to RSVP for today's ceremony, probably because she had to see it to believe it. During her 36 years of teaching, she taught thousands of students. Yet there was just one who got her so wound up that she hit him. I don't know why you assume it was Greg. I think that's a little unfair to Greg. Truthfully, yes, it was me. No laws were broken. It was really just a tap on the arm, but still she was worried she might get in trouble with the school, so she called my mother to explain. My mother's response? Without hesitation, &#x201C;Hit him again.&#x201D; My mother was probably just glad she had someone to help keep me in line. Just as Kim, these women figured out early on that I can be somewhat challenging. As my friends expressed earlier, I do have a bit of a reputation. However, I come by it very honestly. I'm Greek. When people call me "challenging," believe me, my dad is nodding his head in agreement from above. My dad always told us, say what you mean and do what you say. So I've never seen the point in sugarcoating things, especially when that might confuse the issue or slow down progress toward a meaningful result. Those of you who know me know that I operate with an efficiency and honesty that can leave a mark. I am direct, and I am a problem solver. These are both traits that I inherited from my father.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Right now, Texas has a number of problems to resolve, and it's our duty to produce meaningful solutions for all Texans. As we all know, a Texas legislative session is way too short to get caught up in things that don't lead to real results. In a state as big and diverse as Texas, there are plenty of ideas about how we should do any one of these issues, and these ideas often point in a different direction. It's our job to reconcile the differences. This chamber is the perfect place for those ideas to be heard. We must do that with mutual respect and understanding for one another. And in doing so, we will justify the trust that our constituents have placed in us to represent them in this great chamber. I remember a time when we celebrated legislators who were willing to come to the table and find agreement that led to workable solutions. I can admit that I'm a very, very competitive person&#x2013;&#x2013;just ask Jackson or Gregory how much mercy I show them on a family game night. But the work in this chamber cannot be a zero-sum game. Instead, it's a proven system for finding solutions to the challenges that face our state and our constituents daily but only when we work together.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">When it became clear that I would have the privilege of standing here today, I made fostering the spirit of collaboration my number one goal. I tried to visit as many of you in your districts as possible&#x2013;&#x2013;from West Texas to East Texas and from the Panhandle to the Rio Grande Valley&#x2013;&#x2013;to get up close and look at the issues that matter most to you. In many conversations along the way, I would be asked, what is your agenda for the house? I would laugh, then I would explain that's the beauty of being speaker. The agenda is up to you---you as a body, you as the voices of your constituents. My job is simple---bring passionate people to the table, then keep you in the room until we find a solution. That process is going to require a lot of tough conversations with a little give and take. I can tell you from experience that tough conversations are even tougher when they're between strangers or, even worse, adversaries. That's why I have a charge for all of us. I want us to get to know one another even better. While we know one another, we must go beyond that. It's time that we know each other and every member on this floor. Make new friends. Look beyond differences. Learn what life events shaped one another's perspectives. That'll show us that we are all truly connected.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">For instance, you may understand me better when you learn that I grew up in a town of 18,000 people in the district I've represented now for 22 years, well outside of the Houston suburbs, surrounded by rice farms and cattle, among the hardworking people of the Gulf Coast. You will discover that my passion for education centers on the fact that I grew up a dyslexic kid in a small town at a time when there were almost no options available to students like me. My siblings excelled academically; I tried to understand how I fit into the Bonnen gene pool. And you will know that I learned toughness from a mother who fought for me and saw me through my entire education, never taking no for an answer, and finding solutions where people said none existed. That is the root of my tenacity.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Your background and life experiences are a big part of why you are here today. I encourage each of us to be intentional about getting to know one another better; to bridge partisan, geographical, and social divides; and to learn about the passions that inspired each of us to pursue public service in the first place. I encourage our more senior members to invest in the new members of this body, to mentor them so that they can be more effective and efficient, like Tom Uher has done for me and still does today. When we invest in our relationships and mentor one another, we better prepare ourselves to face the challenges before us. Because we have big issues to tackle like school finance and property taxes. These are complicated issues that can no longer wait, pressing issues that deserve a very meaningful result. You might even call them intimidating, but we can advance on them together if we change our perspective and our language. Let's try doing that by applying the words of a sermon I once heard with my sister in college: Replace the words "problem" or "challenge" with "opportunity."</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">In our conversations over the past few months, we shared your passion for a range of opportunities. We have an opportunity to tackle our number one priority, to fix the state's broken school finance system and of course to strive to make Texas schools the best in the country. That also gives us the opportunity to show teachers and retired teachers from Amarillo to Anahuac that we appreciate their years of service and investment in the lives of our children. We have the opportunity to improve the lives of Texas children, from prioritizing early education and improving the CPS system to addressing school safety and mental health issues that underlie the tragic episodes that have shattered Texas communities and families. We have an opportunity to intensify our fight against the despicable crime of human trafficking. When it comes to property taxes, we have an opportunity to reform a broken system that is taxing Texans out of their homes. Opportunities abound in health care, whether we're finding a better way to support trauma care in rapid growth areas like the Rio Grande Valley or educating future medical professionals to fill shortages in our rural communities. The road ahead presents endless opportunities to improve the lives of our constituents, from our state's continued recovery from Hurricane Harvey to the frustrations people feel when they visit one of our state's driver's license offices. I'm convinced we can move the needle on these opportunities if we treat one another with mutual respect and understanding and stay focused on the lives we affect with every vote we take on this floor.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Growing up, whenever Greg, Mark, Eleni or I set out on a new endeavor, my father always told us, leave it better than you found it. That was my dad's advice to me the day I was sworn into this house, and it would be his advice today. So let's be sure that when we adjourn sine die, we leave this house and our state better than we found them. There's a saying we have here in Texas: &#x201C;As Texas goes, so goes the nation.&#x201D; That statement has never rung more true than it does today. Our federal government is steeped in gridlock and partisanship. For Washington, politics has become more important than people. But unlike Washington, Texas stands apart. We lead the nation by doing things our way, and we do it with strength, unity, and resolve. And we will once again rise to the occasion and serve as the nation's model for effective governance. That's what this body has done for over 130 years. We represent the will of the people come hell or high water.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">John Steinbeck nailed it when he described what sets Texas apart. He wrote: &#x201C;For all its enormous range of space, climate, and physical appearance, and for all the internal squabbles, contentions, and strivings, Texas has a tight cohesiveness perhaps stronger than any other section of America. Rich, poor, Panhandle, Gulf, city, country, Texas is the obsession&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;and the passionate possession of all Texans.&#x201D;  This house is the possession of all Texans, and it is our privilege to serve all of them with passion, pride, and a willingness to put the common good above all else. Thank you all, and God bless Texas.</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:0em;line-height:120%;text-align:center;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em"><b>MOTION IN WRITING<br class="hardReturn">AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES</b></div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">The Honorable Diego Bernal of Bexar County offered the following motion in writing:</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:4em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Mr. Speaker:</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:5em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:4em;padding-right:2em">I move to authorize the Speaker to appoint two committees of five members each, one to notify the Senate, and one to notify the Governor that the House is organized and prepared to transact business.</div>

Dennis is a good friend of mine. And I can tell you from personal experience, I know for a fact he's going to be an outstanding speaker not just for this house but for the entire state of Texas. Some people know, but others do not know, over the past two sessions, the amount of time that Dennis and I spent together hashing out all the sometimes minute details, sometimes the big picture issues about what was going to be happening in the closing moments of the legislature. And I can tell you there has been no more passionate advocate for the Texas House than Dennis Bonnen. He used a word moments ago in his own remarks, the word "tenacity." The word "tenacity" is synonymous with Dennis Bonnen. He has an agenda, you have an agenda, and I know working together you and the house will achieve that agenda.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Now, let me take a moment and congratulate every member of the house on your election. I know some of you are reelected. Some like Tom Craddick---was this your 25th election now? Some of you've been elected 25&nbsp;times, some of you've been elected 25&nbsp;years, some of you've been elected 25&nbsp;days. All of you have the opportunity to serve your fellow Texans. I'm proud of you. I'm grateful for you and your service and for the family members and friends who are by your side and circling around this chamber here today. </div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">But more importantly, I want to talk just one moment about this moment in time, if you look through the stretch of Texas history, that you stand on the threshold of. Because if you were to go to Tom Craddick's desk over those past 50&nbsp;years and try to remember and recount the history of the votes that were taken and the impact they had, it would be astounding. And as the members sit in front of your desk today, you can think about the history that was etched in time for whomever it was that sat in that desk. That said, the moment in time is for you to make history. And you'll see, by what I'm about to say, there is almost complete alignment with what I believe is important for the State of Texas, with what the speaker believes is important for the State of Texas, which is what your constituents believe is important for the State of Texas. Because in this moment in time, we have an opportunity to make sure we address the needs of our fellow Texans, including making our schools more resilient to violence and guns and keeping our students and schools safe during the course of school. And that means addressing the mental health challenges that too many students suffer from. And we have the opportunity to make the entire Gulf Coast region more resilient to horrific storms like what struck this past year. But when you really think about the opportunity that lies ahead over the next 140&nbsp;days, you have the ability to alter the arc of the future of Texas---something that's going to be far more lasting than just over the course of the next session or next few years. You're going to have the ability to grapple with and solve issues that have plagued this state for decades, stretching way back into the last century. You have the ability---and we will achieve it---that we are going to reform school finance in the State of Texas this session. And we are going to reform property taxes in Texas this session.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Here is what I know: It could be 10 years; it could be 20&nbsp;years; Tom Craddick, it could be 50&nbsp;years---someone else is going to be sitting at the desk that you are now sitting at. They will know when they come here they are sitting at the desk of someone who altered the course of Texas. Because of what you do this session, you will inspire the next generation of house members. They, too, are going to have the ability to come in here and do exactly what you were able to do this session and that is to make a difference for the State of Texas.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">So as we begin today, I applaud you as we start a session that will be like no other.
