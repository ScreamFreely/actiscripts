          <p>(a) When the board, or complaint committee if authorized by the board, issues a temporary suspension order, the suspension provided for in the order is effective on service of a written copy of the order on the certificate holder or counsel of record. The order must specify the statute, rule, or order violated by the certificate holder. The order remains in effect until the board issues a final order in the matter after a hearing, or on agreement between the board and the certificate holder.</p>
          <p>(b) An order under this subdivision may (1) prohibit the certificate holder from engaging in the practice of barbering in whole or in part, as the facts require, and (2) condition the termination of the suspension on compliance with a statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or issued or is empowered to enforce. The order must state the reasons for entering the order and must set forth the right to a hearing as provided in this subdivision.</p>
          <p>(c) Within ten days after service of an order under this subdivision, the certificate holder may request a hearing in writing. The board must hold a hearing before its own members within five working days of the request for a hearing. The sole issue at such a hearing must be whether there is a reasonable basis to continue, modify, or terminate the temporary suspension. The hearing is not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. Evidence presented to the board or the certificate holder may be in affidavit form only. The certificate holder or counsel of record may appear for oral argument.</p>
          <p>(d) Within five working days after the hearing, the board shall issue its order and, if the order continues the suspension, shall schedule a contested case hearing within 30 days of the issuance of the order. Notwithstanding any rule to the contrary, the administrative law judge shall issue a report within 30 days after the closing of the contested case hearing record. The board shall issue a final order within 30 days of receiving the report.</p>

The board may impose a fee under this paragraph when the board shows that the position of the person who has violated a statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or issued or is empowered to enforce is not substantially justified unless special circumstances make such a fee unjust, notwithstanding any rule to the contrary.

          <h3 class="headnote">Definition.</h3>
          <p class="in">"Hair braiding" means a natural form of hair manipulation that results in tension on hair strands by beading, braiding, cornrowing, extending, lacing, locking, sewing, twisting, weaving, or wrapping human hair, natural fibers, synthetic fibers, and hair extensions into a variety of shapes, patterns, and textures predominantly by hand and by only using simple braiding devices, and maintenance thereof. Hair braiding includes what is commonly known as "African-style hair braiding" or "natural hair care" but is not limited to any particular cultural, ethnic, racial, or religious forms of hair styles. Hair braiding includes the making of customized wigs from natural hair, natural fibers, synthetic fibers, and hair extensions. Hair braiding includes the use of topical agents such as conditioners, gels, moisturizers, oils, pomades, and shampoos. Hair braiding does not involve the use of penetrating chemical hair treatments, chemical hair coloring agents, chemical hair straightening agents, chemical hair joining agents, permanent wave styles, or chemical hair bleaching agents applied to growing human hair. For purposes of this section, "simple hair braiding devices" means clips, combs, curlers, curling irons, hairpins, rollers, scissors, needles, thread, and hair binders including adhesives, if necessary, that are required solely for hair braiding.</p>

          <h3 class="headnote">Temporary suspension.</h3>
          <p>(a) When the board, or complaint committee if authorized by the board, issues a temporary suspension order, the suspension provided for in the order is effective on service of a written copy of the order on the licensee, registrant, or counsel of record. The order must specify the statute, rule, or order violated by the licensee or registrant. The order remains in effect until the board issues a final order in the matter after a hearing, or on agreement between the board and the licensee or registrant.</p>
          <p>(b) An order under this subdivision may (1) prohibit the licensee or registrant from engaging in the practice of a profession regulated by the board in whole or in part, as the facts require, and (2) condition the termination of the suspension on compliance with a statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or issued or is empowered to enforce. The order must state the reasons for entering the order and must set forth the right to a hearing as provided in this subdivision.</p>
          <p>(c) Within ten days after service of an order under this subdivision, the licensee or registrant may request a hearing in writing. The board must hold a hearing before its own members within five working days of the request for a hearing. The sole issue at the hearing must be whether there is a reasonable basis to continue, modify, or terminate the temporary suspension. The hearing is not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. Evidence presented to the board or the licensee or registrant may be in affidavit form only. The licensee, registrant, or counsel of record may appear for oral argument.</p>
          <p>(d) Within five working days after the hearing, the board shall issue its order and, if the order continues the suspension, shall schedule a contested case hearing within 30 days of the issuance of the order. Notwithstanding any rule to the contrary, the administrative law judge shall issue a report within 30 days after the closing of the contested case hearing record. The board shall issue a final order within 30 days of receiving the report.</p>

          <h3 class="headnote">Violations; penalties; costs.</h3>
          <p>(a) The board may impose a civil penalty of up to $2,000 per violation on a person who violates a statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or issued or is empowered to enforce.</p>
          <p>(b) In addition to any penalty under paragraph (a), the board may impose a fee to reimburse the board for all or part of the cost of (1) the proceedings resulting in disciplinary action authorized under this section, (2) the imposition of a civil penalty under paragraph (a), or (3) the issuance of a cease and desist order. The board may impose a fee under this paragraph when the board shows that the position of the person who has violated a statute, rule, or order that the board has adopted or issued or is empowered to enforce is not substantially justified unless special circumstances make such a fee unjust, notwithstanding any rule to the contrary. Costs under this paragraph include, but are not limited to, the amount paid by the board for services from the Office of Administrative Hearings, attorney fees, court reporter costs, witness costs, reproduction of records, board members' compensation, board staff time, and expenses incurred by board members and staff.</p>
          <p>(c) All hearings under this subdivision must be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>

          <p>Upon petition of the former or suspended licensee or registrant, the board may reinstate a suspended, revoked, or surrendered license or registration. The board may in its sole discretion place any conditions on reinstatement of a suspended, revoked, or surrendered license or registration that it finds appropriate and necessary to ensure that the purposes of this chapter are met. No license or registration may be reinstated until the former licensee or registrant has completed at least one-half of the suspension period.</p>
