I want to thank Senators Jane Nelson and John Whitmire for introducing me today.  They both helped me become a better Senator when I joined the Senate in 2007, a better Chairman when I became Education Chair in 2013 and they continue to help me be a better Lieutenant&nbsp;Governor.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">John is the longest serving Democrat, 48 years in the legislature, and Jane is the longest serving Republican, joining the legislature in 1993.  My first session as Lieutenant&nbsp;Governor, I appointed Senator Nelson to be the first female Finance Chair, not because she was a woman, but because she was the best person for the job.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">You may not know this, but Senator Whitmire and I started the first Texas prison seminary &#x2013; and only the second in the nation &#x2013;  for long serving inmates to become 24/7 pastors behind bars.  We've graduated 66 pastors to date and have nearly 200 in the program.  Once they graduate we send them out to other prisons in teams of 4.  The program has had amazing results to date.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">No one is quite sure who wrote this quote, some say Martin Luther King, I'll give him credit for it- it's one of my guiding principles <i>"A person's life begins to end the moment they become silent on things that matter."</i></div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">You and the people of Texas did not elect those of us who are here today to come to Austin to be silent on the things that matter &#x2013; You expect us to work together on the things that matter and in the Texas Senate we do.  You won't hear about this in most of the main stream media because good news doesn't sell, but last session we passed almost 1600 bills in the Texas Senate and only 23 passed on a straight Republican vote.  With all the hoopla in the media, people are amazed by that statistic.  The folks in Washington could learn a lot about working together from the Texas Senate.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">Most of what we do here is not partisan &#x2013; it is all about doing what is best for the state.  We govern the 10th largest economy in the world &#x2013; 28 million people.  Our state is growing and has its challenges, but in Texas, we get our work done.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">Working with my friend and political partner Governor Abbott,  we have had what I think are the two most conservative and productive sessions in history.  We have at or near the lowest unemployment rate in modern history, we continue to be the business and jobs leader in the nation, and Texas continues to be a number one location for businesses to move to.  We passed two conservative budgets, added to our reserve, and protected innocent life, our second amendment rights and our religious liberty.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">But there is still much to do in our fast growing state.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">As Governor Abbott and I traveled the state over the last year talking to Texans about what they want for our state, everywhere we went, three issues always come up that matter to Texans &#x2013; property tax reform, teacher pay, and school finance reform.  Nothing is a bigger threat to the hopes and dreams of Texans than skyrocketing local property taxes that are driving some Texans out of their homes and stifling business growth and expansion.  We must have property tax reform and I am committed to making that happen &#x2013; and I know Governor Abbott and Speaker Bonnen share that commitment.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">We must also secure our border &#x2013; illegal immigration costs Texas billions every year so it must remain a top priority.  Transportation and healthcare are also looming,  multi-billion dollar concerns &#x2013; and, of course, we must fund the rebuilding and recovery of the nearly a quarter of our state that was devastated by Hurricane Harvey.  Following that historic storm, Texas showed the nation and the world what it means when a state pulls together &#x2013; We showed what it means to be TEXAS STRONG!</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">Going into this legislative session, it is clear that finally addressing property taxes, teacher pay and school finance reform are, without question, what people &#x2013; both Republicans and Democrats &#x2013; expect us to resolve.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">Last week, for the first time in modern history, the Governor, our new Speaker and I addressed the state together, laying out our vision for the session.  I don't know what the final property tax, school finance and teacher pay bills will look like &#x2013; that's what session is for &#x2013; but the leadership of our state is united to address those three issues that matter most to Texans.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">I know he was introduced earlier, but I'd like to call Speaker Bonnen up here again, come on up Mr.&nbsp;Speaker, to underscore that we have pledged to work together in an unprecedented way this session along with our Governor.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">Before I close, let me say just a little about education.  I've been talking about increasing teacher pay since our last legislative session.  Today, our teachers  receive only about 32% of our state and local 60 billion a year education budget, even though, next to a parent, they are the most important part of a child's education.  That is going to change!</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">About an hour ago Senator Jane Nelson filed Senate Bill 3 that will be the first across the board pay increase for teachers in nearly 20 years.  Every one of our 350,000 teachers will receive a $5000 raise beginning in the next school year &#x2013; the first step in increasing the base pay of teachers by $10,000.  That $5000 will be added to their pay from now on, meaning they will get $10,000 more total in the next budget.  This is the first step towards an overall increase of the base pay of $10,000.  Senator Nelson is also going to file her budget this afternoon that will include nearly $3.8 billion to fund that pay raise.  It's a big number but again there is nothing more important in education than a great teacher.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">We will also pass legislation giving school districts the money to create their own incentive programs for teacher pay on top of the base raise.  Taking a cue from a group of about 30 Superintendents I meet with regularly, we will also fund schools that want to add 4 weeks to the school calendar in July for students, who are behind and need help.  That will also put more money in teachers' pockets.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">I'm sure the House will also have many ideas along these lines as the session progresses.  I also like the Governor's property tax reform idea and there are many ideas on school finance.  Those are big issues and will take months to resolve but we are committed to solving them.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">I wasn't elected &#x2013; none of us up here were elected &#x2013; to focus on things that don't matter &#x2013; we ran for office because we want to do whatever it takes &#x2013; working across the aisle &#x2013; to do what Sam Houston admonished us to do &#x2013; make our state better for the people of Texas.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">We are facing a critical time in our country and in the world.  Divisions have never been deeper, passions have never been stronger.  I remain a Christian conservative and you know I will never back down on the principles that are making Texas stronger and our country stronger.  Over the decade that I have spent in public office, I have always told you where I stand &#x2013; and I will always tell you where I stand.  And I also know this &#x2013; The world depends on a strong America and America depends on a strong Texas.  I like to say that I didn't come this far to only come this far.  We have a moment in time right now to set the stage for an even greater Texas for future generations.  It is within our grasp.  The elections are over for now &#x2013; we will have them again in two years to air out our differences &#x2013; but for right now, it's time for us to work together for all the people of Texas.  I intend to do my part.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">God bless you and God bless the great state of Texas.</div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:0em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em"><i>(Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepared text)</i></div><br><div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:0em;padding-right:0em">Speaker Bonnen announced that the Constitutional Oath of Office would then be administered to Governor-elect Greg Abbott by Chief Justice Nathan L.

They rightfully point to the fact that more Texans have jobs today than ever before.

      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">A state as prosperous as Texas should not punish seniors who have worked their entire lives to retire in a home they have already paid off.

      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">To fix this, Texas must limit the ability of taxing authorities to raise your property taxes. At the same time, Texas must end unfunded mandates on cities and counties. And taxpayers should be given the power to fire their property tax appraiser.</div>
      <div class="textpara" style="text-indent:2em;line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em">Some cynics say we can't solve these intractable problems. They are too complex. Too political. Too hard. The cynics forget the legendary Texan resolve. The resolve of heroes who fought for Texas liberty while remembering the Alamo.
