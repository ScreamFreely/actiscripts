        <p>(a) For individuals, estates, and trusts, the basis of property is its adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes except as set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f). For corporations, the basis of property is its adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes, without regard to the time when the property became subject to tax under this chapter or to whether out-of-state losses or items of tax preference with respect to the property were not deductible under this chapter, except that the modifications to the basis for federal income tax purposes set forth in paragraphs (b) to (i) are allowed to corporations, and the resulting modifications to federal taxable income must be made in the year in which gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of property is recognized.</p>
        <p>(b) The basis of property shall not be reduced to reflect federal investment tax credit.</p>
        <p>(c) For property acquired before January 1, 1933, the basis for computing a gain is the fair market value of the property as of that date. The basis for determining a loss is the cost of the property to the taxpayer less any depreciation, amortization, or depletion, actually sustained before that date. If the adjusted cost exceeds the fair market value of the property, then the basis is the adjusted cost regardless of whether there is a gain or loss.</p>
        <p>(d) The basis is reduced by the allowance for amortization of bond premium if an election to amortize was made pursuant to Minnesota Statutes 1986, section 290.09, subdivision 13, and the allowance could have been deducted by the taxpayer under this chapter during the period of the taxpayer's ownership of the property.</p>
        <p>(e) For assets placed in service before January 1, 1987, corporations, partnerships, or individuals engaged in the business of mining ores other than iron ore or taconite concentrates subject to the occupation tax under chapter 298 must use the occupation tax basis of property used in that business.</p>
        <p>(f) For assets placed in service before January 1, 1990, corporations, partnerships, or individuals engaged in the business of mining iron ore or taconite concentrates subject to the occupation tax under chapter 298 must use the occupation tax basis of property used in that business.</p>
        <p>(g) In applying the provisions of sections 301(c)(3)(B), 312(f) and (g), and 316(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, the dates December 31, 1932, and January 1, 1933, shall be substituted for February 28, 1913, and March 1, 1913, respectively.</p>
        <p>(h) In applying the provisions of section 362(a) and (c) of the Internal Revenue Code, the date December 31, 1956, shall be substituted for June 22, 1954.</p>
        <p>(i) The basis of property shall be increased by the amount of intangible drilling costs not previously allowed due to differences between this chapter and the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
        <p>(j) The adjusted basis of any corporate partner's interest in a partnership is the same as the adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes modified as required to reflect the basis modifications set forth in paragraphs (b) to (i). The adjusted basis of a partnership in which the partner is an individual, estate, or trust is the same as the adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes modified as required to reflect the basis modifications set forth in paragraphs (e) and (f).</p>
        <p>(k) The modifications contained in paragraphs (b) to (i) also apply to the basis of property that is determined by reference to the basis of the same property in the hands of a different taxpayer or by reference to the basis of different property.</p>

        <p>(1) For the purposes of this paragraph, an individual who becomes a nonresident of Minnesota in any year after an installment sale is required to recognize the full amount of any income or gain described in this paragraph on the individual's final Minnesota resident tax return to the extent that such income has not been recognized in a prior year.</p>
        <p>(2) For the purposes of this section, "realized" has the meaning given in section 1001(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
        <p>(3) For the purposes of this section, "installment sale" means any installment sale under section 453 of the Internal Revenue Code and any other sale that is reported utilizing a method of accounting authorized under subchapter E of the Internal Revenue Code that allows taxpayers to delay reporting or recognizing a realized gain until a future year.</p>
        <p>(4) For the purposes of this section, "allocable amount" means the full amount to be apportioned to Minnesota under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.191">290.191</a> or <a href="/statutes/cite/290.20">290.20</a>, or the full amount to be assigned to Minnesota under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.17">290.17</a>.</p>
        <p>(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), nonresident taxpayers may elect to defer recognizing unrecognized installment sale gains by making an election under this paragraph. The election must be filed on a form to be determined or prescribed by the commissioner and must be filed by the due date of the individual income tax return, including any extension. Electing taxpayers must make an irrevocable agreement to:</p>
        <p>(1) file Minnesota tax returns in all subsequent years when gains from the installment sales are recognized and reported to the Internal Revenue Service;</p>
        <p>(2) allocate gains to the state of Minnesota as though the gains were realized in the year of sale under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.17">290.17</a>, <a href="/statutes/cite/290.191">290.191</a>, or <a href="/statutes/cite/290.20">290.20</a>; and</p>
        <p>(3) include all relevant federal tax documents reporting the installment sale with subsequent Minnesota tax returns.</p>
        <p>(c) Income or gain recognized for Minnesota purposes pursuant to paragraph (a) must be excluded from taxable net income in any future year that the taxpayer files a Minnesota tax return to the extent that the income or gain has already been subject to tax pursuant to paragraph (a).</p>

          <p>(a) A taxpayer who is liable for taxes based on net income to another state, as provided in paragraphs (b) through (f), upon income allocated or apportioned to Minnesota, is entitled to a credit for the tax paid to another state if the tax is actually paid in the taxable year or a subsequent taxable year. A taxpayer who is a resident of this state pursuant to section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.01#stat.290.01.7">290.01, subdivision 7</a>, paragraph (b), and who is subject to income tax as a resident in the state of the individual's domicile is not allowed this credit unless the state of domicile does not allow a similar credit.</p>
          <p>(b) For an individual, estate, or trust, the credit is determined by multiplying the tax payable under this chapter by the ratio derived by dividing the income subject to tax in the other state that is also subject to tax in Minnesota while a resident of Minnesota by the taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income, as defined in section 62 of the Internal Revenue Code, modified by the addition required by section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.0131#stat.290.0131.2">290.0131, subdivision 2</a>, and the subtraction allowed by section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.0132#stat.290.0132.2">290.0132, subdivision 2</a>, to the extent the income is allocated or assigned to Minnesota under sections <a href="/statutes/cite/290.081">290.081</a> and <a href="/statutes/cite/290.17">290.17</a>.</p>

          <p>(d)(1) The credit determined under paragraph (b) or (c) shall not exceed the amount of tax so paid to the other state on the gross income earned within the other state subject to tax under this chapter; and</p>
          <p>(2) the allowance of the credit does not reduce the taxes paid under this chapter to an amount less than what would be assessed if the gross income earned within the other state were excluded from taxable net income.</p>
          <p>(e) In the case of the tax assessed on a lump-sum distribution under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.032">290.032</a>, the credit allowed under paragraph (a) is the tax assessed by the other state on the lump-sum distribution that is also subject to tax under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.032">290.032</a>, and shall not exceed the tax assessed under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.032">290.032</a>.

          <p>(f) If a Minnesota resident reported an item of income to Minnesota and is assessed tax in such other state on that same income after the Minnesota statute of limitations has expired, the taxpayer shall receive a credit for that year under paragraph (a), notwithstanding any statute of limitations to the contrary. The claim for the credit must be submitted within one year from the date the taxes were paid to the other state. The taxpayer must submit sufficient proof to show entitlement to a credit.</p>

For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "net income tax" means any tax imposed on or measured by a corporation's net income.</p>
          <p>(h) For the purposes of this subdivision, a resident partner of an entity taxed as a partnership under the Internal Revenue Code must be considered to have paid a tax imposed on the partner in an amount equal to the partner's pro rata share of any net income tax paid by the partnership to another state. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "net income" tax means any tax imposed on or measured by a partnership's net income.</p>
          <p>(i) For the purposes of this subdivision, "another state":</p>

          <p>(2) excludes Puerto Rico and the several territories organized by Congress.</p>
          <p>(j) The limitations on the credit in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d), are imposed on a state by state basis.</p>
          <p>(k) For a tax imposed by a province or territory of Canada, the tax for purposes of this subdivision is the excess of the tax over the amount of the foreign tax credit allowed under section 27 of the Internal Revenue Code. In determining the amount of the foreign tax credit allowed, the net income taxes imposed by Canada on the income are deducted first. Any remaining amount of the allowable foreign tax credit reduces the provincial or territorial tax that qualifies for the credit under this subdivision.</p>
          <p>(l)(1) The credit allowed to a qualifying individual under this section for tax paid to a qualifying state equals the credit calculated under paragraphs (b) and (d), plus the amount calculated by multiplying:</p>
          <p>(i) the difference between the preliminary credit and the credit calculated under paragraphs (b) and (d), by</p>
          <p>(ii) the ratio derived by dividing the income subject to tax in the qualifying state that consists of compensation for performance of personal or professional services by the total amount of income subject to tax in the qualifying state.</p>
          <p>(2) If the amount of the credit that a qualifying individual is eligible to receive under clause (1) for tax paid to a qualifying state exceeds the tax due under this chapter before the application of the credit calculated under clause (1), the commissioner shall refund the excess to the qualifying individual. An amount sufficient to pay the refunds required by this subdivision is appropriated to the commissioner from the general fund.</p>
          <p class="in">(3) For purposes of this paragraph, "preliminary credit" means the credit that a qualifying individual is eligible to receive under paragraphs (b) and (d) for tax paid to a qualifying state without regard to the limitation in paragraph (d), clause (2); "qualifying individual" means a Minnesota resident under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.01#stat.290.01.7">290.01, subdivision 7</a>, paragraph (a), who received compensation during the taxable year for the performance of personal or professional services within a qualifying state; and "qualifying state" means a state with which an agreement under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.081">290.081</a> is not in effect for the taxable year but was in effect for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2010.</p>

          <p>(a) A taxpayer may claim a refund equal to the amount of the taxpayer's contributions made in the calendar year to candidates and to a political party. The maximum refund for an individual must not exceed $50 and for a married couple, filing jointly, must not exceed $100. A refund of a contribution is allowed only if the taxpayer files a form required by the commissioner and attaches to the form a copy of an official refund receipt form issued by the candidate or party and signed by the candidate, the treasurer of the candidate's principal campaign committee, or the chair or treasurer of the party unit, after the contribution was received. The receipt forms must be numbered, and the data on the receipt that are not public must be made available to the campaign finance and public disclosure board upon its request. A claim must be filed with the commissioner no sooner than January 1 of the calendar year in which the contribution was made and no later than April 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the contribution was made. A taxpayer may file only one claim per calendar year. Amounts paid by the commissioner after June 15 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the contribution was made must include interest at the rate specified in section <a href="/statutes/cite/270C.405">270C.405</a>.</p>
          <p>(b) No refund is allowed under this subdivision for a contribution to a candidate unless the candidate:</p>
          <p>(1) has signed an agreement to limit campaign expenditures as provided in section <a href="/statutes/cite/10A.322">10A.322</a>;</p>
          <p>(2) is seeking an office for which voluntary spending limits are specified in section <a href="/statutes/cite/10A.25">10A.25</a>; and</p>
          <p>(3) has designated a principal campaign committee.</p>
          <p>This subdivision does not limit the campaign expenditures of a candidate who does not sign an agreement but accepts a contribution for which the contributor improperly claims a refund.</p>
          <p>(c) For purposes of this subdivision, "political party" means a major political party as defined in section <a href="/statutes/cite/200.02#stat.200.02.7">200.02, subdivision 7</a>, or a minor political party qualifying for inclusion on the income tax or property tax refund form under section <a href="/statutes/cite/10A.31#stat.10A.31.3a">10A.31, subdivision 3a</a>.</p>
          <p>A "major party" or "minor party" includes the aggregate of that party's organization within each house of the legislature, the state party organization, and the party organization within congressional districts, counties, legislative districts, municipalities, and precincts.</p>
          <p>"Candidate" means a candidate as defined in section <a href="/statutes/cite/10A.01#stat.10A.01.10">10A.01, subdivision 10</a>, except a candidate for judicial office.</p>
          <p>"Contribution" means a gift of money.</p>
          <p>(d) The commissioner shall make copies of the form available to the public and candidates upon request.</p>
          <p>(e) The following data collected or maintained by the commissioner under this subdivision are private: the identities of individuals claiming a refund, the identities of candidates to whom those individuals have made contributions, and the amount of each contribution.</p>
          <p>(f) The commissioner shall report to the campaign finance and public disclosure board by each August 1 a summary showing the total number and aggregate amount of political contribution refunds made on behalf of each candidate and each political party. These data are public.</p>
          <p>(g) The amount necessary to pay claims for the refund provided in this section is appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of revenue.</p>
          <p>(h) For a taxpayer who files a claim for refund via the Internet or other electronic means, the commissioner may accept the number on the official receipt as documentation that a contribution was made rather than the actual receipt as required by paragraph (a).</p>

          <p>(a) A credit is allowed against the tax imposed under subdivision 1 for tax paid to another state based on net income. The credit must be claimed in a manner prescribed by the commissioner.</p>
          <p>(b) The amount of the credit equals the amount of qualifying tax paid to the other state for the taxable year, multiplied by the taxpayer's apportionment percentage under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.191">290.191</a>. If the item of income or gain is assigned to Minnesota as nonbusiness income, the entire amount of the qualifying tax is allowed as a credit. The maximum amount of the credit is limited to the tax liability under subdivision 1 for the taxable year and, in no case, may the credit exceed the reduction in the amount of tax under subdivision 1 if the item of income or gain were excluded from net income.</p>
          <p>(c) For purposes of this subdivision, "qualifying tax" means the amount of tax paid to another state on an item of income or gain for the taxable year, if:</p>
          <p>(1) the law of another state requires and the taxpayer assigns the entire amount of the income or gain to one other state; and</p>
          <p>(2) the income or gain is included in the measure of the exercise of the corporate franchise that is taxable under subdivision 1.</p>
          <p>(d) The amount of tax paid to another state on an item of income or gain is the difference between the tax paid to the state and the amount of tax that would have been paid to the state if the item of income or gain had not been included in the net income of that state.</p>
          <p>(e) The taxpayer must report to the commissioner of revenue any change in tax in the other state, the change in qualifying tax, and a copy of the final determination of the tax by the taxing authority of the other state. A taxpayer who claims the credit consents to extend the period of limitation for the commissioner to recompute the credit and reassess the tax due, including a refund, for a period of one year following a report by the taxpayer of a final determination of tax by the state in which the entire amount of income or gain is reported, notwithstanding any period of limitations to the contrary, or within any applicable period of limitations, whichever is longer. If a taxpayer fails to report as required by this paragraph, the commissioner may recompute the tax, including a refund, based on the information available to the commissioner. The tax may be recomputed within six years after the report should have been filed, notwithstanding any period of limitations to the contrary.</p>

The amount of the total credit determined at the pass-through entity level must be allowed to the members in proportion to their respective interests in the pass-through entity.</p>

          <p class="in">(e) The entire amount of an investment for which a credit is claimed under this subdivision must be expended by the qualified business for plant, equipment, research and development, marketing and sales activity, or working capital for the qualified business.</p>
          <p class="in">(f) A taxpayer who owns a controlling interest in the qualified business or who receives more than 50 percent of the taxpayer's gross annual income from the qualified business is not entitled to a credit under this subdivision. A member of the immediate family of a taxpayer disqualified by this subdivision is not entitled to the credit under this subdivision. For purposes of this subdivision, "immediate family" means the taxpayer's spouse, parent, sibling, or child or the spouse of any such person.</p>

          <h3 class="headnote">Credit allowed.</h3>
          <p>(a) An individual who is a resident of Minnesota is allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter equal to a percentage of earned income. To receive a credit, a taxpayer must be eligible for a credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that a taxpayer with no qualifying children who has attained the age of 21, but not attained age 65 before the close of the taxable year and is otherwise eligible for a credit under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code may also receive a credit.</p>
          <p>(b) For individuals with no qualifying children, the credit equals 2.10 percent of the first $6,180 of earned income. The credit is reduced by 2.01 percent of earned income or adjusted gross income, whichever is greater, in excess of $8,130, but in no case is the credit less than zero.</p>
          <p>(c) For individuals with one qualifying child, the credit equals 9.35 percent of the first $11,120 of earned income. The credit is reduced by 6.02 percent of earned income or adjusted gross income, whichever is greater, in excess of $21,190, but in no case is the credit less than zero.</p>
          <p>(d) For individuals with two or more qualifying children, the credit equals 11 percent of the first $18,240 of earned income. The credit is reduced by 10.82 percent of earned income or adjusted gross income, whichever is greater, in excess of $25,130, but in no case is the credit less than zero.</p>
          <p>(e) For a part-year resident, the credit must be allocated based on the percentage calculated under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.06#stat.290.06.2c">290.06, subdivision 2c</a>, paragraph (e).</p>
          <p>(f) For a person who was a resident for the entire tax year and has earned income not subject to tax under this chapter, including income excluded under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.0132#stat.290.0132.10">290.0132, subdivision 10</a>, the credit must be allocated based on the ratio of federal adjusted gross income reduced by the earned income not subject to tax under this chapter over federal adjusted gross income. For purposes of this paragraph, the following clauses are not considered "earned income not subject to tax under this chapter":</p>
          <p>(1) the subtractions for military pay under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.0132#stat.290.0132.11">290.0132, subdivisions 11</a> and 12;</p>
          <p>(2) the exclusion of combat pay under section 112 of the Internal Revenue Code; and</p>
          <p>(3) income derived from an Indian reservation by an enrolled member of the reservation while living on the reservation.</p>
          <p>(g) For tax years beginning after December 31, 2013, the $8,130 in paragraph (b), the $21,190 in paragraph (c), and the $25,130 in paragraph (d), after being adjusted for inflation under subdivision 7, are each increased by $5,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2013, the commissioner shall annually adjust the $5,000 by the percentage determined pursuant to the provisions of section 1(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, except that in section 1(f)(3)(B), the word "2008" shall be substituted for the word "1992." For 2014, the commissioner shall then determine the percent change from the 12 months ending on August 31, 2008, to the 12 months ending on August 31, 2013, and in each subsequent year, from the 12 months ending on August 31, 2008, to the 12 months ending on August 31 of the year preceding the taxable year. The earned income thresholds as adjusted for inflation must be rounded to the nearest $10. If the amount ends in $5, the amount is rounded up to the nearest $10. The determination of the commissioner under this subdivision is not a rule under the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
          <p>(h) The commissioner shall construct tables showing the amount of the credit at various income levels and make them available to taxpayers. The tables shall follow the schedule contained in this subdivision, except that the commissioner may graduate the transition between income brackets.</p>

The excess of the subtraction base amount over the taxable net income computed without regard to the subtraction for the elderly or disabled under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.0132#stat.290.0132.5">290.0132, subdivision 5</a>, may be used to reduce the amount of a lump sum distribution subject to tax under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.032">290.032</a>.</p>
          <p>(b)(1) The initial subtraction base amount equals</p>
          <p>(i) $12,000 for a married taxpayer filing a joint return if a spouse is a qualified individual,</p>
          <p>(ii) $9,600 for a single taxpayer, and</p>
          <p>(iii) $6,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate federal return.</p>
          <p>(2) The qualified individual's initial subtraction base amount, then, must be reduced by the sum of nontaxable retirement and disability benefits and one-half of the amount of adjusted gross income in excess of the following thresholds:</p>
          <p>(i) $18,000 for a married taxpayer filing a joint return if both spouses are qualified individuals,</p>
          <p>(ii) $14,500 for a single taxpayer or for a married couple filing a joint return if only one spouse is a qualified individual, and</p>
          <p>(iii) $9,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate federal return.</p>
          <p>(3) In the case of a qualified individual who is under the age of 65, the maximum amount of the subtraction base may not exceed the taxpayer's disability income.</p>
          <p>(4) The resulting amount is the subtraction base amount.</p>

        <h1 class="shn">290.081 INCOME OF NONRESIDENTS, RECIPROCITY.</h1>
        <p>(a) The compensation received for the performance of personal or professional services within this state by an individual whose residence, place of abode, and place customarily returned to at least once a month is in another state, shall be excluded from gross income to the extent such compensation is subject to an income tax imposed by the state of residence; provided that such state allows a similar exclusion of compensation received by residents of Minnesota for services performed therein.</p>
        <p>(b) When it is deemed to be in the best interests of the people of this state, the commissioner may determine that the provisions of paragraph (a) shall not apply. As long as the provisions of paragraph (a) apply between Minnesota and Wisconsin, the provisions of paragraph (a) shall apply to any individual who is domiciled in Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>(c) For the purposes of paragraph (a), whenever the Wisconsin tax on Minnesota residents which would have been paid Wisconsin without paragraph (a) exceeds the Minnesota tax on Wisconsin residents which would have been paid Minnesota without paragraph (a), or vice versa, then the state with the net revenue loss calculated under paragraph (e) shall receive from the other state the amount of such loss.</p>
        <p>(d) Payments for amounts calculated under paragraph (c) must equal one-quarter of the estimated annual amount and must be paid at the midpoint of each quarter, on February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15.</p>
        <p>(e)(1) The commissioner of revenue is authorized to enter into agreements with the state of Wisconsin specifying the reciprocity payment due dates, conditions constituting delinquency, interest rates, and a method for computing interest due.</p>
        <p>(2) For agreements entered into before August 1, 2018, the annual compensation required under paragraph (c) must equal at least the net revenue loss minus up to $3,000,000 per fiscal year.</p>
        <p>(3) For the purposes of this section, "net revenue loss" means the difference between the amount of Minnesota income taxes Minnesota forgoes by not taxing Wisconsin residents on income subject to reciprocity and the credit Minnesota would have been required to give under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.06#stat.290.06.22">290.06, subdivision 22</a>, to Minnesota residents working in Wisconsin had there not been reciprocity.</p>
        <p>(4) All agreements must include provisions:</p>
        <p>(i) providing for a suspension of the agreement if one party to the agreement does not pay in full by a time prescribed in the agreement;</p>
        <p>(ii) setting the interest rate that will be applied, and that interest shall run from the date the payment is due until the day the payment is made, except that interest from the reconciliation payments runs from July 1 of the tax year until paid;</p>
        <p>(iii) stating a time for annual reconciliation must be completed by October 31 of the year following the tax year, and the time for payment of any amounts to be completed by no later than December 1 of the year following the tax year;</p>
        <p>(iv) requiring the parties to jointly conduct updated benchmark studies every five years beginning tax year 2018;</p>
        <p>(v) requiring each party to the agreement to require taxpayers who request exemption from withholding in the state where they work to make an annual application and that a list of participants will be exchanged annually; and</p>
        <p>(vi) that provide that the sum of the amount of the quarterly payments must be a reasonable estimate of the revenue loss as defined in clause (3).</p>
        <p>(f) If an agreement cannot be reached as to the amount of the loss, the commissioner of revenue and the taxing official of the state of Wisconsin shall each appoint a member of a board of arbitration and these members shall appoint the third member of the board. The board shall select one of its members as chair. Such board may administer oaths, take testimony, subpoena witnesses, and require their attendance, require the production of books, papers and documents, and hold hearings at such places as are deemed necessary. The board shall then make a determination as to the amount to be paid the other state which determination shall be final and conclusive.</p>
        <p>(g) The commissioner may furnish copies of returns, reports, or other information to the taxing official of the state of Wisconsin, a member of the board of arbitration, or a consultant under joint contract with the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin for the purpose of making a determination as to the amount to be paid the other state under the provisions of this section. Prior to the release of any information under the provisions of this section, the person to whom the information is to be released shall sign an agreement which provides that the person will protect the confidentiality of the returns and information revealed thereby to the extent that it is protected under the laws of the state of Minnesota.</p>

          <h3 class="headnote">Carryover credit.</h3>
          <p>(a) A corporation is allowed a credit against qualified regular tax for qualified alternative minimum tax previously paid. The credit is allowable only if the corporation has no tax liability under this section for the taxable year and if the corporation has an alternative minimum tax credit carryover from a previous year. The credit allowable in a taxable year equals the lesser of</p>
          <p>(1) the excess of the qualified regular tax for the taxable year over the amount computed under subdivision 1, clause (1), for the taxable year or</p>
          <p>(2) the carryover credit to the taxable year.</p>
          <p>(b) For purposes of this subdivision, the following terms have the meanings given.</p>
          <p>(1) "Qualified alternative minimum tax" equals the amount determined under subdivision 1 for the taxable year.</p>
          <p>(2) "Qualified regular tax" means the tax imposed under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.06#stat.290.06.1">290.06, subdivision 1</a>.</p>
          <p>(c) The qualified alternative minimum tax for a taxable year is an alternative minimum tax credit carryover to each of the taxable years succeeding the taxable year. The entire amount of the credit must be carried to the earliest taxable year to which the amount may be carried. Any unused portion of the credit must be carried to the following taxable year. No credit may be carried to a taxable year in which alternative minimum tax was paid.</p>
          <p>(d) An acquiring corporation may carry over this credit from a transferor or distributor corporation in a corporate acquisition. The provisions of section 381 of the Internal Revenue Code apply in determining the amount of the carryover, if any.</p>

          <p>(b) The term "unitary business" means business activities or operations which result in a flow of value between them. The term may be applied within a single legal entity or between multiple entities and without regard to whether each entity is a sole proprietorship, a corporation, a partnership or a trust.</p>
          <p>(c) Unity is presumed whenever there is unity of ownership, operation, and use, evidenced by centralized management or executive force, centralized purchasing, advertising, accounting, or other controlled interaction, but the absence of these centralized activities will not necessarily evidence a nonunitary business. Unity is also presumed when business activities or operations are of mutual benefit, dependent upon or contributory to one another, either individually or as a group.</p>
          <p>(d) Where a business operation conducted in Minnesota is owned by a business entity that carries on business activity outside the state different in kind from that conducted within this state, and the other business is conducted entirely outside the state, it is presumed that the two business operations are unitary in nature, interrelated, connected, and interdependent unless it can be shown to the contrary.</p>

A foreign corporation or other foreign entity which is not included on a combined report and which is required to file a return under this chapter shall file on a separate return basis.</p>
          <p>(g) For purposes of determining the net income of a unitary business and the factors to be used in the apportionment of net income pursuant to section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.191">290.191</a> or <a href="/statutes/cite/290.20">290.20</a>, there must be included only the income and apportionment factors of domestic corporations or other domestic entities that are determined to be part of the unitary business pursuant to this subdivision, notwithstanding that foreign corporations or other foreign entities might be included in the unitary business; except that the income and apportionment factors of a foreign entity, other than an entity treated as a C corporation for federal income tax purposes, that is included in the federal taxable income, as defined in section 63 of the Internal Revenue Code as amended through the date named in section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.01#stat.290.01.19">290.01, subdivision 19</a>, of a domestic corporation, domestic entity, or individual must be included in determining net income and the factors to be used in the apportionment of net income pursuant to section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.191">290.191</a> or <a href="/statutes/cite/290.20">290.20</a>.</p>
          <p>(h) Each corporation or other entity, except a sole proprietorship, that is part of a unitary business must file combined reports as the commissioner determines. On the reports, all intercompany transactions between entities included pursuant to paragraph (g) must be eliminated and the entire net income of the unitary business determined in accordance with this subdivision is apportioned among the entities by using each entity's Minnesota factors for apportionment purposes in the numerators of the apportionment formula and the total factors for apportionment purposes of all entities included pursuant to paragraph (g) in the denominators of the apportionment formula. Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (f), all sales of the unitary business made within this state pursuant to section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.191">290.191</a> or <a href="/statutes/cite/290.20">290.20</a> must be included on the combined report of a corporation or other entity that is a member of the unitary business and is subject to the jurisdiction of this state to impose tax under this chapter.</p>

          <p class="in">For purposes of this section, the following rules apply in determining the sales factor.</p>
          <p class="in">(a) The sales factor includes all sales, gross earnings, or receipts received in the ordinary course of the business, except that the following types of income are not included in the sales factor:</p>
          <p class="in">(1) interest;</p>
          <p class="in">(2) dividends;</p>
          <p class="in">(3) sales of capital assets as defined in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code;</p>
          <p class="in">(4) sales of property used in the trade or business, except sales of leased property of a type which is regularly sold as well as leased; and</p>
          <p class="in">(5) sales of debt instruments as defined in section 1275(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code or sales of stock.</p>
          <p class="in">(b) Sales of tangible personal property are made within this state if the property is received by a purchaser at a point within this state, regardless of the f.o.b. point, other conditions of the sale, or the ultimate destination of the property.</p>
          <p class="in">(c) Tangible personal property delivered to a common or contract carrier or foreign vessel for delivery to a purchaser in another state or nation is a sale in that state or nation, regardless of f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale.</p>
          <p class="in">(d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c), when intoxicating liquor, wine, fermented malt beverages, cigarettes, or tobacco products are sold to a purchaser who is licensed by a state or political subdivision to resell this property only within the state of ultimate destination, the sale is made in that state.</p>
          <p class="in">(e) Sales made by or through a corporation that is qualified as a domestic international sales corporation under section 992 of the Internal Revenue Code are not considered to have been made within this state.</p>
          <p class="in">(f) Sales, rents, royalties, and other income in connection with real property is attributed to the state in which the property is located.</p>
          <p class="in">(g) Receipts from the lease or rental of tangible personal property, including finance leases and true leases, must be attributed to this state if the property is located in this state and to other states if the property is not located in this state. Receipts from the lease or rental of moving property including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, rolling stock, aircraft, vessels, or mobile equipment are included in the numerator of the receipts factor to the extent that the property is used in this state. The extent of the use of moving property is determined as follows:</p>
          <p class="in">(1) A motor vehicle is used wholly in the state in which it is registered.</p>
          <p class="in">(2) The extent that rolling stock is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts from the lease or rental of the rolling stock by a fraction, the numerator of which is the miles traveled within this state by the leased or rented rolling stock and the denominator of which is the total miles traveled by the leased or rented rolling stock.</p>
          <p class="in">(3) The extent that an aircraft is used in this state is determined by multiplying the receipts from the lease or rental of the aircraft by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of landings of the aircraft in this state and the denominator of which is the total number of landings of the aircraft.</p>
          <p class="in">(4) The extent that a vessel, mobile equipment, or other mobile property is used in the state is determined by multiplying the receipts from the lease or rental of the property by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the taxable year the property was in this state and the denominator of which is the total days in the taxable year.</p>
          <p class="in">(h) Royalties and other income received for the use of or for the privilege of using intangible property, including patents, know-how, formulas, designs, processes, patterns, copyrights, trade names, service names, franchises, licenses, contracts, customer lists, or similar items, must be attributed to the state in which the property is used by the purchaser. If the property is used in more than one state, the royalties or other income must be apportioned to this state pro rata according to the portion of use in this state. If the portion of use in this state cannot be determined, the royalties or other income must be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator. Intangible property is used in this state if the purchaser uses the intangible property or the rights therein in the regular course of its business operations in this state, regardless of the location of the purchaser's customers.</p>
          <p class="in">(i) Sales of intangible property are made within the state in which the property is used by the purchaser. If the property is used in more than one state, the sales must be apportioned to this state pro rata according to the portion of use in this state. If the portion of use in this state cannot be determined, the sale must be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator of the sales factor. Intangible property is used in this state if the purchaser used the intangible property in the regular course of its business operations in this state.</p>
          <p class="in">(j) Receipts from the performance of services must be attributed to the state where the services are received. For the purposes of this section, receipts from the performance of services provided to a corporation, partnership, or trust may only be attributed to a state where it has a fixed place of doing business. If the state where the services are received is not readily determinable or is a state where the corporation, partnership, or trust receiving the service does not have a fixed place of doing business, the services shall be deemed to be received at the location of the office of the customer from which the services were ordered in the regular course of the customer's trade or business. If the ordering office cannot be determined, the services shall be deemed to be received at the office of the customer to which the services are billed.</p>
          <p class="in">(k) For the purposes of this subdivision and subdivision 6, paragraph (l), receipts from management, distribution, or administrative services performed by a corporation or trust for a fund of a corporation or trust regulated under United States Code, title 15, sections 80a-1 through 80a-64, must be attributed to the state where the shareholder of the fund resides. Under this paragraph, receipts for services attributed to shareholders are determined on the basis of the ratio of: (1) the average of the outstanding shares in the fund owned by shareholders residing within Minnesota at the beginning and end of each year; and (2) the average of the total number of outstanding shares in the fund at the beginning and end of each year. Residence of the shareholder, in the case of an individual, is determined by the mailing address furnished by the shareholder to the fund. Residence of the shareholder, when the shares are held by an insurance company as a depositor for the insurance company policyholders, is the mailing address of the policyholders. In the case of an insurance company holding the shares as a depositor for the insurance company policyholders, if the mailing address of the policyholders cannot be determined by the taxpayer, the receipts must be excluded from both the numerator and denominator. Residence of other shareholders is the mailing address of the shareholder.</p>

          <p class="in">(b) "Receipts" for this purpose means gross income, including net taxable gain on disposition of assets, including securities and money market instruments, when derived from transactions and activities in the regular course of the taxpayer's trade or business.</p>
          <p class="in">(c) "Money market instruments" means federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, commercial paper, banker's acceptances, and purchased certificates of deposit and similar instruments to the extent that the instruments are reflected as assets under generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
          <p class="in">(d) "Securities" means United States Treasury securities, obligations of United States government agencies and corporations, obligations of state and political subdivisions, corporate stock, bonds, and other securities, participations in securities backed by mortgages held by United States or state government agencies, loan-backed securities and similar investments to the extent the investments are reflected as assets under generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
          <p class="in">(e) Receipts from the lease or rental of real or tangible personal property, including both finance leases and true leases, must be attributed to this state if the property is located in this state. Receipts from the lease or rental of tangible personal property that is characteristically moving property, including, but not limited to, motor vehicles, rolling stock, aircraft, vessels, or mobile equipment are included in the numerator of the receipts factor to the extent that the property is used in this state. The extent of the use of moving property is determined as follows:</p>

          <p class="in">(a) "Deposit," as used in subdivision 6, paragraph (n), has the meanings in this subdivision.</p>
          <p class="in">(b) "Deposit" means the unpaid balance of money or its equivalent received or held by a financial institution in the usual course of business and for which it has given or is obligated to give credit, either conditionally or unconditionally, to a commercial, checking, savings, time, or thrift account whether or not advance notice is required to withdraw the credited funds, or which is evidenced by its certificate of deposit, thrift certificate, investment certificate, or certificate of indebtedness, or other similar name, or a check or draft drawn against a deposit account and certified by the financial institution, or a letter of credit or a traveler's check on which the financial institution is primarily liable. However, without limiting the generality of the term "money or its equivalent," any such account or instrument must be regarded as evidencing the receipt of the equivalent of money when credited or issued in exchange for checks or drafts or for a promissory note upon which the person obtaining the credit or instrument is primarily or secondarily liable, or for a charge against a deposit account, or in settlement of checks, drafts, or other instruments forwarded to the bank for collection.</p>
          <p class="in">(c) "Deposit" means trust funds received or held by the financial institution, whether held in the trust department or held or deposited in any other department of the financial institution.</p>

Under this paragraph, "deposit" includes, but is not limited to, escrow funds, funds held as security for an obligation due to the financial institution or others, including funds held as dealers reserves, or for securities loaned by the financial institution, funds deposited by a debtor to meet maturing obligations, funds deposited as advance payment on subscriptions to United States government securities, funds held for distribution or purchase of securities, funds held to meet its acceptances or letters of credit, and withheld taxes. It does not include funds received by the financial institution for immediate application to the reduction of an indebtedness to the receiving financial institution, or under condition that the receipt of the funds immediately reduces or extinguishes the indebtedness.</p>
          <p class="in">(e) "Deposit" means outstanding drafts, including advice or another such institution, cashier's checks, money orders, or other officer's checks issued in the usual course of business for any purpose, but not including those issued in payment for services, dividends, or purchases or other costs or expenses of the financial institution itself.</p>
          <p class="in">(f) "Deposit" means money or its equivalent held as a credit balance by a financial institution on behalf of its customer if the entity is engaged in soliciting and holding such balances in the regular course of its business.</p>

          <p>For all taxpayers, the property factor includes tangible property, real, personal, and mixed, owned or rented, and used by the taxpayer in connection with the trade or business, as set forth in subdivision 10. For financial institutions only, the property factor also includes intangible property, as set forth in subdivision 11. For both tangible and intangible property, the property included in the property factor is the average of the total property used by the taxpayer in connection with its business during the tax period. Such averages must be on a commensurate basis for property within and without the state.</p>

          <h3 class="headnote">Property factor; tangible property.</h3>
          <p>(a) Tangible property includes land, buildings, machinery and equipment, inventories, and other tangible personal property actually used by the taxpayer during the taxable year in carrying on the business activities of the taxpayer. Tangible property which is separately allocated under section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.17">290.17</a> is not includable in the property factor.</p>
          <p>(b) Cash on hand or in banks, shares of stock, notes, bonds, accounts receivable, or other evidences of indebtedness, special privileges, franchises, and goodwill, are specifically excluded from the property factor, except as otherwise provided for financial institutions in subdivision 11.</p>
          <p>(c) The value of tangible property that is owned by the taxpayer and that is to be used in the apportionment fraction is the original cost adjusted for any later capital additions or improvements and partial disposition by reason of sale, exchange, or abandonment.</p>
          <p>(d) For purposes of computing the property factor, United States government property that is used by the taxpayer must be considered owned by the taxpayer.</p>
          <p>(e) Property that is rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight times the net annual rental. Net annual rental is the annual rental paid by the taxpayer less any annual rental received by the taxpayer from subrentals. If the subrents taken into account in determining the net annual rental produce a negative or clearly inaccurate value for any item of property, another method that will properly reflect the value of rented property may be required by the commissioner or requested by the taxpayer. In no case, however, shall the value be less than an amount which bears the same ratio to the annual rental paid by the taxpayer for such property as the fair market value of that portion of the property used by the taxpayer bears to the total fair market value of the rented property. Rents paid during the year cannot be averaged.</p>
          <p>(f) A person filing a combined report shall use this method of calculating the property factor for all members of the group.</p>

In the case of an unregulated financial institution, the assets are apportioned to this state based upon the ratio that its gross business income earned from sources within this state bears to gross business income earned from sources within all states.

        <p>(1) A taxpayer who is permitted to change the basis for reporting income from a fiscal to a calendar year shall make a separate return for the period between the close of the taxpayer's last fiscal year and the following December 31st; if the change is from a calendar to a fiscal year, a separate return shall be made for the period between the close of the taxpayer's last calendar year and the date designated as the close of the fiscal year; and if the change is from one fiscal year to another fiscal year, a separate return shall be made for the period between the close of the former fiscal year and the date designated as the close of the new fiscal year. The taxable net income, or for corporations the taxable net income as reduced by the deductions contained in section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.21">290.21</a>, for any such period shall be put on an annual basis by multiplying the amount thereof by 12 and dividing by the number of months included in the period for which such separate return is made; and the tax shall be that part of a tax, computed on the taxable net income put on such annual basis which the number of months in such period bears to 12 months.</p>

Where the short period is 359 days or more, the tax shall be computed in the same manner as if such short period were an entire year.</p>

          <h3 class="headnote">Registration; third-party bulk filer.</h3>
          <p>(a) For purposes of this subdivision, the following terms have the meanings given:</p>
          <p>(1) Notwithstanding section <a href="/statutes/cite/290.01">290.01</a>, "person" means an individual, fiduciary, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, association, or other entity organized under the laws of this state or any other jurisdiction.</p>
          <p>(2) "Third-party bulk filer" means a person who has custody or control over another employer's funds for the purpose of filing returns and depositing the withheld taxes of the other employer with the commissioner.</p>
          <p>(b) A person shall not act as a third-party bulk filer unless the person is registered with the commissioner under this subdivision.</p>
          <p>(c) A person may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, for registration as a third-party bulk filer under this subdivision, and the commissioner shall grant the application if the application indicates that the person will comply with this subdivision.</p>
          <p>(d) A third-party bulk filer must:</p>
          <p>(1) keep client funds held for payment of federal or state withholding taxes or other client obligations in an account separate from the third-party bulk filer's own funds;</p>
          <p>(2) permit the commissioner to conduct scheduled or unscheduled audits of the third-party bulk filer's books and records relating to compliance with this subdivision and fully cooperate with the audits or, at the discretion of the commissioner, submit an audit conducted by a certified public accountant;</p>
          <p>(3) file returns electronically and make deposits electronically with the commissioner in compliance with the commissioner's requirements for electronic filing and depositing;</p>
          <p>(4) provide to the commissioner at least monthly, in the form requested by the commissioner, an updated client list that includes at least the name, address, tax identification number, and federal deposit frequency of each client. The address listed for the client must be the client's actual street or post office box address and not the third-party bulk filer's address;</p>
          <p>(5) disclose in writing to prospective clients that:</p>
          <p>(i) the third-party bulk filer may invest client funds prior to depositing them with the commissioner and with the Internal Revenue Service and that earnings from those investments will be the property of the third-party bulk filer;</p>
          <p>(ii) if the third-party bulk filer incurs losses on those investments or uses the client's funds for other purposes, the third-party bulk filer will still be liable to the client for the amounts withheld but will be able to make required tax deposits on behalf of the client only by using the third-party bulk filer's own funds or other assets to replace the funds lost through the investments or used for other purposes; and</p>
          <p>(iii) no state or federal agency monitors or assumes any responsibility for the financial solvency of third-party bulk filers;</p>
          <p>(6) timely file all returns and timely make all tax deposits required under its contracts with its clients;</p>
          <p>(7) upon request, provide to the commissioner, within the time specified in the request, a copy of any contract with a client; and</p>
          <p>(8) comply with all other requirements of this section or of rules adopted under this section.</p>
          <p>(e) When the commissioner sends an order of assessment issued under section <a href="/statutes/cite/270C.33">270C.33</a>, in either paper or electronic form, to a third-party bulk filer regarding a client, the commissioner shall also send a paper copy of the order of assessment to the client.</p>
          <p>(f) If the commissioner determines that a required deposit appears not to have been made, the commissioner shall send a written notice of the delinquency, in electronic or paper form, to the third-party bulk filer, and a copy to the client as required under paragraph (e).</p>
          <p>(g) If the commissioner determines that a required deposit has not been made, and that continued operation of the third-party bulk filer would present a risk of loss to its clients, the commissioner may, upon ten business days' written notice by certified mail to the third-party bulk filer, suspend the registration of the third-party bulk filer for an indefinite period, and notify the third-party bulk filer's clients that the registration has been suspended. A registration may not be suspended if the failure to make a deposit was caused by the client's failure to deposit funds or provide the information necessary to calculate appropriate tax withholding payments. The commissioner shall, upon request, provide the third-party bulk filer with the opportunity for an administrative appeal under section <a href="/statutes/cite/270C.35#stat.270C.35.1, 4, a 10">270C.35, subdivisions 1, 4, and 10</a>, prior to suspension; the hearing, if any, on the administrative appeal must occur within the ten-day period unless the commissioner, in the commissioner's sole discretion, agrees to delay the suspension to permit a later hearing. The 60-day period specified in section <a href="/statutes/cite/270C.35#stat.270C.35.4">270C.35, subdivision 4</a>, does not apply to a proceeding under this paragraph. Within 30 days after the beginning of a suspension under this paragraph, the commissioner may commence a proceeding to suspend or revoke under paragraph (h); if the commissioner fails to do so, the suspension under this paragraph terminates.</p>
          <p>(h) If the commissioner determines, in compliance with paragraph (i), that a third-party bulk filer has violated this section without reasonable cause or is no longer eligible for registration under this subdivision, the commissioner may suspend or revoke the third-party bulk filer's registration or may assess a civil penalty upon the third-party bulk filer, not to exceed $5,000 per violation. A suspension of registration may be for any period of less than six months and may include conditions for reinstatement. If the commissioner revokes the registration, the third-party bulk filer may not apply for reregistration for six months after the revocation. If the commissioner suspends or revokes a registration, the commissioner shall notify the former registrant's clients that the registration has been suspended or revoked. If the commissioner assesses a civil penalty, the commissioner shall not notify the third-party bulk filer's clients of the assessment.</p>
          <p>(i) Prior to a suspension, revocation, or assessment of a civil penalty under paragraph (h), the commissioner shall first provide 30 days' written notice to the third-party bulk filer, specifying the violations and informing the third-party bulk filer that the commissioner intends, based upon those violations, to take action against the third-party bulk filer as permitted under this paragraph and paragraph (h). The notice shall advise the third-party bulk filer of the right to contest the suspension, revocation, or assessment of a civil penalty and of the general procedures for a contested case hearing under chapter 14. The notice may be served personally or by mail in the manner prescribed for service of an order of assessment issued under section <a href="/statutes/cite/270C.33">270C.33</a>. A suspension or revocation of registration under this paragraph is effective when the commissioner serves a notice of suspension or revocation upon the third-party bulk filer after 30 days have passed following the date of the notice of intent to suspend or revoke without the third-party bulk filer requesting a hearing. If a hearing is timely requested and held, the suspension or revocation is effective upon service by the commissioner of an order of suspension or revocation under section <a href="/statutes/cite/14.62#stat.14.62.1">14.62, subdivision 1</a>.</p>
          <p>(j) A third-party bulk filer may terminate its registration by written notice to the commissioner, but the termination does not affect the commissioner's authority to begin or continue a proceeding to take action permitted under paragraph (h). The commissioner shall notify the third-party bulk filer's clients of a termination of registration under this paragraph.</p>
          <p>(k) The commissioner shall remind employers at least annually, through the department's regular informational publications that it sends to employers, that employers may telephone the department to determine whether a required filing or deposit has been made by a third-party bulk filer.</p>

        <h1 class="shn">297D.04 TAX PAYMENT REQUIRED FOR POSSESSION.</h1>
        <p>No tax obligor may possess any marijuana or controlled substance upon which a tax is imposed by section <a href="/statutes/cite/297D.08">297D.08</a> unless the tax has been paid on the marijuana or other controlled substance as evidenced by a stamp or other official indicia.</p>

        <p>For the purpose of calculating the tax under section <a href="/statutes/cite/297D.08">297D.08</a>, a quantity of marijuana or other controlled substance is measured by the weight of the substance whether pure or impure or dilute, or by dosage units when the substance is not sold by weight, in the tax obligor's possession.

          <p class="in">(a) Within ten days after the seizure of any alleged contraband, the person making the seizure shall serve by certified mail an inventory of the property seized on the person from whom the seizure was made, if known, and on any person known or believed to have any right, title, interest, or lien in the property, at the last known address, and file a copy with the commissioner. The notice must include an explanation of the right to demand a judicial forfeiture determination.</p>

The demand must be in the form of a civil complaint and must be filed with the court administrator in the county in which the seizure occurred, together with proof of service of a copy of the complaint on the commissioner of revenue, and the standard filing fee for civil actions unless the petitioner has the right to sue in forma pauperis under section <a href="/statutes/cite/563.01">563.01</a>. If the value of the seized property is $15,000 or less, the claimant may file an action in conciliation court for recovery of the property. If the value of the seized property is less than $500, the claimant does not have to pay the conciliation court filing fee.</p>
          <p class="in">(c) The complaint must be captioned in the name of the claimant as plaintiff and the seized property as defendant, and must state with specificity the grounds on which the claimant alleges the property was improperly seized and the plaintiff's interest in the property seized. No responsive pleading is required of the commissioner, and no court fees may be charged for the commissioner's appearance in the matter. The proceedings are governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an action for the return of property seized under this section may not be maintained by or on behalf of any person who has been served with an inventory unless the person has complied with this subdivision. The court shall decide whether the alleged contraband is contraband, as defined in subdivision 1. The court shall hear the action without a jury and shall try and determine the issues of fact and law involved.</p>
          <p class="in">(d) When a judgment of forfeiture is entered, unless the judgment is stayed pending an appeal, the commissioner:</p>
          <p class="in">(1) may authorize the forfeited property to be used for the purpose of enforcing a criminal provision of state or federal law;</p>
          <p class="in">(2) shall cause forfeited cigarette packages or tobacco products not used under clause (1) to be destroyed and products used under clause (1) to be destroyed upon the completion of use; and</p>
          <p class="in">(3) may cause the forfeited property, other than forfeited cigarette packages or tobacco products, to be sold at public auction as provided by law.</p>
          <p class="in">The person making a sale, after deducting the expense of keeping the property, the fee for seizure, and the costs of the sale, shall pay all liens according to their priority, which are established as being bona fide and as existing without the lienor having any notice or knowledge that the property was being used or was intended to be used for or in connection with the violation. The balance of the proceeds must be paid 75 percent to the Department of Revenue for deposit as a supplement to its operating fund or similar fund for official use, and 25 percent to the county attorney or other prosecuting agency that handled the court proceeding, if there is one, for deposit as a supplement to its operating fund or similar fund for prosecutorial purposes. If there is no prosecuting authority involved in the forfeiture, the 25 percent of the proceeds otherwise designated for the prosecuting authority must be deposited into the general fund.</p>
          <p class="in">(e) If no demand for judicial determination is made, the property seized is considered forfeited to the state by operation of law and may be disposed of by the commissioner as provided in the case of a judgment of forfeiture.</p>

          <p>(a) A tax is imposed on distributors on the sale of cigarettes by a cigarette distributor to a retailer or cigarette subjobber for resale in this state. The tax is equal to the combined tax rate under section <a href="/statutes/cite/297A.62">297A.62</a>, multiplied by the weighted average retail price and must be expressed in cents per pack rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent. The weighted average retail price must be determined annually, with new rates published by November 1, and effective for sales on or after January 1 of the following year. The weighted average retail price must be established by surveying cigarette retailers statewide in a manner and time determined by the commissioner. The commissioner shall make an inflation adjustment in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers inflation indicator as published in the most recent state budget forecast. The commissioner shall use the inflation factor for the calendar year in which the new tax rate takes effect. If the survey indicates that the average retail price of cigarettes has not increased relative to the average retail price in the previous year's survey, then the commissioner shall not make an inflation adjustment. The determination of the commissioner pursuant to this subdivision is not a "rule" and is not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act contained in chapter 14. For packs of cigarettes with other than 20 cigarettes, the tax must be adjusted proportionally.</p>
          <p>(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), and in lieu of a survey of cigarette retailers, the tax calculation of the weighted average retail price for the sales of cigarettes from August 1, 2011, through December 31, 2011, shall be calculated by: (1) increasing the average retail price per pack of 20 cigarettes from the most recent survey by the percentage change in a weighted average of the presumed legal prices for cigarettes during the year after completion of that survey, as reported and published by the Department of Commerce under section <a href="/statutes/cite/325D.371">325D.371</a>; (2) subtracting the sales tax included in the retail price; and (3) adjusting for expected inflation. The rate must be published by May 1 and is effective for sales after July 31. If the weighted average of the presumed legal prices indicates that the average retail price of cigarettes has not increased relative to the average retail price in the most recent survey, then no inflation adjustment must be made. For packs of cigarettes with other than 20 cigarettes, the tax must be adjusted proportionally.</p>

No responsive pleading is required of the commissioner of revenue or public safety and no court fees may be charged for either commissioner's appearance in the matter. The proceedings are governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an action for the return of property seized under this section may not be maintained by or on behalf of any person who has been served with an inventory unless the person has complied with this subdivision. The court shall hear the action without a jury and determine the issues of fact and law involved.</p>
          <p>(d) If a judgment of forfeiture is entered, the seizing authority may, unless the judgment is stayed pending an appeal, either:</p>
          <p>(1) cause the forfeited property, other than a vehicle, to be destroyed; or</p>
          <p>(2) cause it to be sold at a public auction as provided by law.</p>
          <p>The person making a sale, after deducting the expense of keeping the property, the fee for seizure, and the costs of the sale, shall pay all liens according to their priority, which are established as being bona fide and as existing without the lienor having any notice or knowledge that the property was being used or was intended to be used for or in connection with the violation. The balance of the proceeds must be paid 75 percent to the seizing authority for deposit as a supplement to its operating fund or similar fund for official use, and 25 percent to the county attorney or other prosecuting agency that handled the court proceeding, if there is one, for deposit as a supplement to its operating fund or similar fund for prosecutorial purposes. If there is no prosecuting authority involved in the forfeiture, the 25 percent of the proceeds otherwise designated for the prosecuting authority must be deposited into the general fund.</p>
          <p>(e) If no demand is made, the property seized is considered forfeited to the seizing authority by operation of law and may be disposed of by the seizing authority as provided for a judgment of forfeiture.</p>

          <p>(a) An insurance company may offset against its premium tax liability to this state any amount paid for assessments made for insolvencies which occur after July 31, 1994, under sections <a href="/statutes/cite/60C.01">60C.01</a> to <a href="/statutes/cite/60C.22">60C.22</a>; and any amount paid for assessments made after July 31, 1994, under Minnesota Statutes 1992, sections <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.01">61B.01</a> to <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.16">61B.16</a>, or under sections <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.18">61B.18</a> to <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.32">61B.32</a> as follows:</p>
          <p>(1) Each such assessment shall give rise to an amount of offset equal to 20 percent of the amount of the assessment for each of the five calendar years following the year in which the assessment was paid.</p>
          <p>(2) The amount of offset initially determined for each taxable year is the sum of the amounts determined under clause (1) for that taxable year.</p>
          <p>(b)(1) Each year the commissioner shall compare total guaranty association assessments levied over the preceding five calendar years to the sum of all premium tax and corporate franchise tax revenues collected from insurance companies, without reduction for any guaranty association assessment offset in the preceding calendar year, referred to in this subdivision as "preceding year insurance tax revenues."</p>
          <p>(2) If total guaranty association assessments levied over the preceding five years exceed the preceding year insurance tax revenues, insurance companies must be allowed only a proportionate part of the premium tax offset calculated under paragraph (a) for the current calendar year.</p>
          <p>(3) The proportionate part of the premium tax offset allowed in the current calendar year is determined by multiplying the amount calculated under paragraph (a) by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction equals the preceding year insurance tax revenues, and its denominator equals total guaranty association assessments levied over the preceding five-year period.</p>
          <p>(4) The proportionate part of the premium tax offset that is not allowed must be carried forward to subsequent tax years and added to the amount of premium tax offset calculated under paragraph (a) prior to application of the limitation imposed by this paragraph.</p>
          <p>(5) Any amount carried forward from prior years must be allowed before allowance of the offset for the current year calculated under paragraph (a).</p>
          <p>(6) The premium tax offset limitation must be calculated separately for (i) insurance companies subject to assessment under sections <a href="/statutes/cite/60C.01">60C.01</a> to <a href="/statutes/cite/60C.22">60C.22</a>, and (ii) insurance companies subject to assessment under Minnesota Statutes 1992, sections <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.01">61B.01</a> to <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.16">61B.16</a>, or <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.18">61B.18</a> to <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.32">61B.32</a>.</p>
          <p>(7) When the premium tax offset is limited by this provision, the commissioner shall notify affected insurance companies on a timely basis for purposes of completing premium and corporate franchise tax returns.</p>
          <p>(8) The guaranty associations created under sections <a href="/statutes/cite/60C.01">60C.01</a> to <a href="/statutes/cite/60C.22">60C.22</a>, Minnesota Statutes 1992, sections <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.01">61B.01</a> to <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.16">61B.16</a>, and <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.18">61B.18</a> to <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.32">61B.32</a>, shall provide the commissioner with the necessary information on guaranty association assessments.</p>
          <p>(c)(1) If the offset determined by the application of paragraphs (a) and (b) exceeds the insurance company's premium tax liability under this section prior to allowance of the credit for premium taxes, then the insurance company may carry forward the excess, referred to in this subdivision as the "carryforward credit" to subsequent taxable years.</p>
          <p>(2) The carryforward credit is allowed as an offset against premium tax liability for the first succeeding year to the extent that the premium tax liability for that year exceeds the amount of the allowable offset for the year determined under paragraphs (a) and (b).</p>
          <p>(3) The carryforward credit must be reduced, but not below zero, by the amount of the carryforward credit allowed as an offset against the premium tax under this paragraph. The remainder, if any, of the carryforward credit must be carried forward to succeeding taxable years until the entire carryforward credit has been credited against the insurance company's liability for premium tax under this chapter if applicable for that taxable year.</p>
          <p>(d) When an insurer has offset against taxes its payment of an assessment of the Minnesota Life and Health Guaranty Association, and the association pays the insurer a refund with respect to the assessment under Minnesota Statutes 1992, section <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.07#stat.61B.07.6">61B.07, subdivision 6</a>, or <a href="/statutes/cite/61B.24#stat.61B.24.6">61B.24, subdivision 6</a>, then the refund reduces the insurer's carryforward credit under paragraph (c). If the refund exceeds the amount of the carryforward credit, the excess amount must be repaid to the state by the insurers to the extent of the offset in the manner the commissioner requires.</p>
