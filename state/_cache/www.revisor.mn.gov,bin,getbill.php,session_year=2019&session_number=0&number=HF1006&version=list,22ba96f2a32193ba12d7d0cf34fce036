          <p>(b) Paragraph (a) does not apply if by June 1, 2013, the legislature enacts regulatory requirements that:</p>
          <p>(1) apply uniformly to all health carriers and health plans in the individual market;</p>
          <p>(2) apply uniformly to all health carriers and health plans in the small group market; and</p>
          <p>(3) satisfy minimum federal certification requirements under section 1311(c)(1) of the Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148.</p>
          <p>(c) In accordance with section 1311(e) of the Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148, the board shall establish policies and procedures for certification and selection of health plans to be offered as qualified health plans through MNsure. The board shall certify and select a health plan as a qualified health plan to be offered through MNsure, if:</p>
          <p>(1) the health plan meets the minimum certification requirements established in paragraph (a) or the market regulatory requirements in paragraph (b);</p>
          <p>(2) the board determines that making the health plan available through MNsure is in the interest of qualified individuals and qualified employers;</p>
          <p>(3) the health carrier applying to offer the health plan through MNsure also applies to offer health plans at each actuarial value level and service area that the health carrier currently offers in the individual and small group markets; and</p>
          <p>(4) the health carrier does not apply to offer health plans in the individual and small group markets through MNsure under a separate license of a parent organization or holding company under section <a href="/statutes/cite/60D.15">60D.15</a>, that is different from what the health carrier offers in the individual and small group markets outside MNsure.</p>

          <p>(7) alignment and coordination with state agency and private sector purchasing strategies and payment reform efforts; and</p>
          <p>(8) other criteria that the board determines appropriate.</p>
          <p>(e) For qualified health plans offered through MNsure on or after January 1, 2015, the board shall establish policies and procedures under paragraphs (c) and (d) for selection of health plans to be offered as qualified health plans through MNsure by February 1 of each year, beginning February 1, 2014. The board shall consistently and uniformly apply all policies and procedures and any requirements, standards, or criteria to all health carriers and health plans. For any policies, procedures, requirements, standards, or criteria that are defined as rules under section <a href="/statutes/cite/14.02#stat.14.02.4">14.02, subdivision 4</a>, the board may use the process described in subdivision 9.</p>
          <p>(f) For 2014, the board shall not have the power to select health carriers and health plans for participation in MNsure. The board shall permit all health plans that meet the certification requirements under section 1311(c)(1) of the Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148, to be offered through MNsure.</p>
          <p>(g) Under this subdivision, the board shall have the power to verify that health carriers and health plans are properly certified to be eligible for participation in MNsure.</p>
          <p>(h) The board has the authority to decertify health carriers and health plans that fail to maintain compliance with section 1311(c)(1) of the Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148.</p>
          <p>(i) For qualified health plans offered through MNsure beginning January 1, 2015, health carriers must use the most current addendum for Indian health care providers approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the tribes as part of their contracts with Indian health care providers.

          <p>(a) The board may conduct hearings, appoint hearing officers, and recommend final orders related to appeals of any MNsure determinations, except for those determinations identified in paragraph (d). An appeal by a health carrier regarding a specific certification or selection determination made by MNsure under subdivision 5 must be conducted as a contested case proceeding under chapter 14, with the report or order of the administrative law judge constituting the final decision in the case, subject to judicial review under sections <a href="/statutes/cite/14.63 ">14.63 </a>to <a href="/statutes/cite/14.69">14.69</a>. For other appeals, the board shall establish hearing processes which provide for a reasonable opportunity to be heard and timely resolution of the appeal and which are consistent with the requirements of federal law and guidance. An appealing party may be represented by legal counsel at these hearings, but this is not a requirement.</p>
          <p>(b) MNsure may establish service-level agreements with state agencies to conduct hearings for appeals. Notwithstanding section <a href="/statutes/cite/471.59">471.59</a>, subdivision 1, a state agency is authorized to enter into service-level agreements for this purpose with MNsure.</p>
          <p>(c) For proceedings under this subdivision, MNsure may be represented by an attorney who is an employee of MNsure.</p>
          <p>(d) This subdivision does not apply to appeals of determinations where a state agency hearing is available under section <a href="/statutes/cite/256.045">256.045</a>.</p>
          <p>(e) An appellant aggrieved by an order of MNsure issued in an eligibility appeal, as defined in Minnesota Rules, part <a href="/rules/?id=7700.0101">7700.0101</a>, may appeal the order to the district court of the appellant's county of residence by serving a written copy of a notice of appeal upon MNsure and any other adverse party of record within 30 days after the date MNsure issued the order, the amended order, or order affirming the original order, and by filing the original notice and proof of service with the court administrator of the district court. Service may be made personally or by mail; service by mail is complete upon mailing; no filing fee shall be required by the court administrator in appeals taken pursuant to this subdivision. MNsure shall furnish all parties to the proceedings with a copy of the decision and a transcript of any testimony, evidence, or other supporting papers from the hearing held before the appeals examiner within 45 days after service of the notice of appeal.</p>
          <p>(f) Any party aggrieved by the failure of an adverse party to obey an order issued by MNsure may compel performance according to the order in the manner prescribed in sections <a href="/statutes/cite/586.01">586.01</a> to <a href="/statutes/cite/586.12">586.12</a>.</p>
          <p>(g) Any party may obtain a hearing at a special term of the district court by serving a written notice of the time and place of the hearing at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. The court may consider the matter in or out of chambers, and shall take no new or additional evidence unless it determines that such evidence is necessary for a more equitable disposition of the appeal.</p>
          <p>(h) Any party aggrieved by the order of the district court may appeal the order as in other civil cases. No costs or disbursements shall be taxed against any party nor shall any filing fee or bond be required of any party.</p>
          <p>(i) If MNsure or district court orders eligibility for qualified health plan coverage through MNsure, or eligibility for federal advance payment of premium tax credits or cost-sharing reductions contingent upon full payment of respective premiums, the premiums must be paid or provided pending appeal to the district court, court of appeals, or supreme court. Provision of eligibility by MNsure pending appeal does not render moot MNsure's position in a court of law.</p>
