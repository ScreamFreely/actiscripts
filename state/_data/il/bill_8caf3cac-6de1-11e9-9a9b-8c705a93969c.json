In a provision permitting a Housing Authority to refuse to certify or recertify applicants, current tenants, or other household members who have been convicted of a criminal offense relating to the sale or distribution of a controlled substance, provides that prior to refusing to certify or recertify such a person, the Authority shall make an individualized assessment and determine whether it is reasonable to conclude that the applicant, current tenant, or other household member would constitute a threat to those in the community where the applicant, current tenant, or other household member would reside; or whether it is reasonable to conclude that the applicant, current tenant, or other household member would otherwise engage in other unlawful activities in that community. Provides that during the individualized assessment, the Authority shall consider all mitigating circumstances, including, but not limited to: the nature of the crime; the time elapsed between the date of conviction and the date of certification or recertification; the applicant's, tenant's, or other household member's background; the incentive to litigate the criminal matter; and any evidence demonstrating rehabilitation. Requires the Authority to provide notice to the applicant, current tenant, or other household member that he or she may be denied certification or recertification because of a criminal conviction and that he or she has the right to an impartial hearing to demonstrate that he or she should not be denied certification or recertification because of his or her particular circumstances.", "date": ""}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Prefiled with Clerk by Rep.
