Provides that if an employee of a school district or a regional office of education fails to perform a criminal history records check or a check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database as required under the Code for an applicant seeking employment with the school district or ignores the results of any of those checks, he or she must be suspended from employment.
