She was named Co-Most Valuable Freshman of the 2017 session of the Texas Legislature after passing bills to provide tax relief, reduce the size and scope of government, eliminate waste and abuse, cut unnecessary regulation, protect public safety, defend veterans, streamline healthcare, and encourage job creation and economic development.\r  \r Dr. Buckingham's forefathers were among the first settlers to Texas seven generations ago, and that tough, independent, pioneer spirit is deeply rooted in her personality. Dr. Buckingham's commitment to service began early, serving as a volunteer fire fighter, and she is a graduate of the A&M Fire School. She is also an avid hunter and outdoorswoman.\r  \r Dr. Buckingham lived at home and worked two jobs to pay for college at UT-Austin, graduating Magna Cum Laude and debt-free. It was during college that Dawn met the love of her life and husband of 25 years, Ed Buckingham. Dawn and Ed both received their medical degrees from the Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, and they have two children. Her commitment to service and recognition for her work has allowed her to hold leadership positions in local, state, and national medical organizations.", "national_identity": "", "contact_details": [{"type": "address", "value": "P.O.
