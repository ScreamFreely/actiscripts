Senator Hall graduated from The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina with a degree in Electrical Engineering and received a Regular Commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the US Air Force. While a cadet at the Citadel he received numerous awards for leadership. He was the only Air Force Cadet selected to be a Battalion Commander and was awarded the coveted Wade Hampton saber as the graduating cadet who had contributed the most to the Citadel during the four years he was a cadet, and was listed in \"Who's Who In American Colleges\" his Senior year. Upon graduation, Bob began his active duty as a Systems Engineer working to develop the Minuteman Missile System during the Cold War at Norton AFB in California, where he achieved the rank of Captain.\r \r After the Air Force he worked in the Aerospace industry as a systems engineer and business development manager. In 1982 he left the corporate world and began working as an independent proposal consultant to aerospace and defense corporations. Then in 1984 he formed his own company,  \r \r A compelling sense of duty, shaped by his military service, business experience, and love for this country, drives him to leave behind the legacy of a patriotic servant for his children and grandchildren.
